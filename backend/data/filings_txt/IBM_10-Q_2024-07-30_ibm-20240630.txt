Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1.
Basis of Presentation:
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes of the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM or the company) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). The financial statements and footnotes are unaudited. In the opinion of the company’s management, these statements include all adjustments, which are only of a normal recurring nature, necessary to present a fair statement of the company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs, expenses and other comprehensive income/(loss) that are reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying disclosures. These estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events, historical experience, actions that the company may undertake in the future and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. As a result, actual results may be different from these estimates.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the company reported a provision for income taxes of $
389
million and a benefit from income taxes of $
112
million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was
17.5
percent and (
3.4
) percent, respectively. The benefit from income taxes in the six months ended June 30, 2024, was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the company reported a provision for income taxes of $
419
million and $
543
million, respectively, and the effective tax rate was
21.0
percent and
17.8
percent, respectively.
Noncontrolling interest amounts, included as a reduction within other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement, were not material to the consolidated results for the periods presented.
The company has supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions where the company agrees to pay the financial institutions the stated amounts of invoices from participating suppliers on the originally invoiced maturity date, which have an average term of
90
to
120
days, consistent with the company's standard payment terms. The financial institutions offer earlier payment of the invoices at the sole discretion of the supplier for a discounted amount. The company does not provide secured legal assets or other forms of guarantees under the arrangements. The company is not a party to the arrangements between its suppliers and the financial institutions. These obligations are recognized as accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The obligations outstanding under these programs at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were $
116
million and $
101
million, respectively.
Interim results are not necessarily indicative of financial results for a full year. The information included in this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the company’s 2023 Annual Report.
Within the financial statements and tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the change in current-period presentation. This is annotated where applicable.

Accounting Changes:
New Standards to be Implemented
Income Tax Disclosures
Standard/Description
–Issuance date: December 2023.

10
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
Effective Date and Adoption Considerations
–The guidance is effective January 1, 2025 and early adoption is permitted. The company expects to adopt the guidance as of the effective date.
Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters
–As the guidance is a change to disclosures only, it will impact the “Taxes” note within the company's annual financial statements but will not impact the consolidated financial results.
Segment Reporting Disclosures
Standard/Description
–Issuance date: November 2023. This guidance requires the disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to a company's chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The company must also disclose “other segment items,” which is the difference between segment revenue less significant expenses for each reported measure of segment profit or loss, and a description of its composition. This guidance also requires all segment annual disclosures to be provided on an interim basis.
Effective Date and Adoption Considerations
–The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning in 2024, and for interim periods beginning January 1, 2025, and is required to be applied on a retrospective basis to all prior periods presented. Early adoption is permitted. The company will adopt the guidance as of the effective date.
Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters
–As the guidance is a change to disclosures only, it will impact the “Segments” note within the company's quarterly and annual financial statements but will not have an impact in the consolidated financial results.
Standards Implemented
Disclosures of Supplier Finance Program Obligations
Standard/Description–
Issuance date: September 2022. This guidance requires an entity to provide certain interim and annual disclosures about the use of supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods or services.
Effective Date and Adoption Considerations–
The guidance was effective January 1, 2023 with certain annual disclosures required beginning in 2024 and early adoption was permitted. The company adopted the guidance as of the effective date.
Effect on Financial Statements or Other Significant Matters–
As the guidance is a change to disclosures only, it did not have an impact in the consolidated financial results. Refer to note 1, "Basis of Presentation," for additional disclosure information.

Revenue Recognition:
Disaggregation of Revenue
The following tables provide details of revenue by major products/service offerings and revenue by geography.
Revenue by Major Products/Service Offerings
(1)
Recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes. Refer to note 4, "Segments," for additional information.
(2)
Contains lease and loan financing arrangements which are not subject to the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers.
Revenue by Geography
Remaining Performance Obligations
The remaining performance obligation (RPO) disclosure provides the aggregate amount of the transaction price yet to be recognized as of the end of the reporting period and an explanation as to when the company expects to recognize these amounts in revenue. It is intended to be a statement of overall work under contract that has not yet been performed and does not include contracts in which the customer is not committed, such as certain as-a-Service, governmental, term software license and services offerings. The customer is not considered committed when they are able to terminate for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty. The disclosure includes estimates of variable consideration, except when the variable consideration is a sales-based or usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property. Additionally, as a practical expedient, the company does not include contracts that have an original duration of
one year
or less. RPO estimates are subject to change and are affected by several factors, including terminations, changes in the scope of contracts, periodic revalidations, adjustment for revenue that has not materialized and adjustments for currency.
12
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
At June 30, 2024, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to RPO related to customer contracts that are unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied was approximately $
56

70
percent of the amount is expected to be recognized as revenue in the subsequent
two years
, approximately
27
percent in the subsequent
three
to
five years
and the balance thereafter.
Revenue Recognized for Performance Obligations Satisfied (or Partially Satisfied) in Prior Periods
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, revenue recognized for performance obligations satisfied or partially satisfied in prior periods was immaterial.

Segments:
In the first quarter of 2024, the company made changes to its organization structure and management system to better align its portfolio with the market, increase transparency and improve segment comparability to peers. These changes did not impact the company's Consolidated Financial Statements, but did impact its reportable segments. Due to the removal of certain components of segment profitability, as described below, the company also updated the title of its segment performance metric from pre-tax income from continuing operations to segment profit.
The following table displays the segment updates:

Acquisitions & Divestitures:
Acquisitions
Purchase price consideration for all acquisitions was paid primarily in cash. All acquisitions, unless otherwise stated, were for
100
percent of the acquired business and are reported in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, net of acquired cash and cash equivalents.
During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the company completed
two
acquisitions within the Software segment and
two
acquisitions within the Consulting segment at an aggregate cost of $
278
million. These acquisitions are expected to enhance the company’s portfolio of products and services capabilities and further advance IBM’s hybrid cloud and AI strategy. These acquisitions did not have a material impact in the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
At June 30, 2024, the remaining cash to be remitted by the company related to the first-half 2024 acquisitions was not material.
The following table reflects the purchase price related to these acquisitions and the resulting purchase price allocation as of June 30, 2024.
N/A – not applicable
The valuation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to revision. If additional information becomes available, the company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practical, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.

Transactions Closed in Third-Quarter 2024 — At the time of issuance of the financial statements, the initial purchase price accounting for each of the closed acquisitions below was not complete.
On July 1, 2024, the company completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG for approximately $
2.3
billion (€
2.13
billion) in cash. StreamSets will add new data ingestion capabilities to IBM's data platform and webMethods will bring integration platform-as-a-service (iPaaS) capabilities to IBM's automation solutions. The acquisition will be integrated into the Software segment. Prior to the acquisition, the company entered into foreign currency derivative contracts which expired by June 28, 2024. Refer to note 16, “Derivative Financial Instruments,” for financial impacts and additional information. At June 30, 2024, $
2.3
billion was held in escrow and classified as restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in connection with the acquisition. The cash was remitted to Software AG on July 1, 2024.
On July 1, 2024, the company completed an acquisition within the Consulting segment which is not expected to have a material impact on the company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Transactions Announced — On April 24, 2024, the company announced its intent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HashiCorp, Inc. (HashiCorp). IBM’s and HashiCorp’s combined portfolios will help clients manage growing application and infrastructure complexity and create a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, HashiCorp's shareholders on record immediately prior to the effective time on the closing date will receive $
35
per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $
6.4
billion. On July 15, 2024, HashiCorp stockholders voted to approve the merger with IBM. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, HashiCorp will be integrated into the Software segment.
Divestitures
The Weather Company Assets — On January 31, 2024, the company completed the sale of The Weather Company assets to Zephyr Buyer, L.P., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Francisco Partners (collectively, Francisco). Under the agreement, Francisco acquired The Weather Company assets from IBM for $
1,100
million inclusive of $
250
million of contingent consideration, of which $
200
million is contingent on Francisco’s attainment of certain investment return metrics. The assets include The Weather Company's digital consumer-facing offerings, The Weather Channel mobile and cloud-based digital properties including Weather.com, Weather Underground and Storm Radar, as well as its enterprise offerings for broadcast, media, aviation, advertising technology and data solutions for other emerging industries.
Upon closing, the company received cash proceeds of $
750
million and provided seller financing to Francisco in the form of a $
100
million loan with a term of
7
years. The cash proceeds from the sale were included in cash from investing activities within the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The seller financing is a non-cash investing activity. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, the company recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $
239
million in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. As discussed in note 4, “Segments,” in the first quarter of 2024, The Weather Company assets previously reported in the Software segment were moved and recast to the
Other–divested businesses category.

Sale of Assets
Transaction Signed — In May 2024, IBM and Palo Alto Networks (Palo Alto) entered into a definitive agreement whereby Palo Alto will acquire from IBM certain QRadar SaaS (software-as-a-service) assets including QRadar intellectual property, customer relationships and customer contracts for approximately $
500
million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. The company expects to recognize a pre-tax gain on the sale of assets, of which the final amount is not yet determinable.
Upon closing, IBM and Palo Alto will facilitate the migration of QRadar SaaS and IBM's QRadar on-premise (on-prem) clients to Palo Alto’s Cortex XSIAM, their security operations (SOC) platform. As part of the agreement, IBM will receive incremental future cash payments from Palo Alto for QRadar on-prem clients that choose to migrate to the Cortex XSIAM platform.
Also, in connection with the sale of the QRadar SaaS assets, IBM and Palo Alto will enter into various commercial agreements pursuant to which IBM will purchase certain Palo Alto products and services and IBM will license and/or provide certain software, including SaaS, and consulting services to Palo Alto. IBM will also provide Palo Alto with transition services including support, operations and other services for QRadar SaaS customer contracts. The commercial agreements entered into during the second quarter of 2024 did not have a material impact on IBM's Consolidated Financial Statements.
At June 30, 2024, the sale of the QRadar SaaS assets met the criteria for held for sale classification. Held for sale assets of approximately $
113
million, consisting primarily of intangible assets – net, and held for sale liabilities of $
37
million, consisting primarily of deferred income, were included in the company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2024. These held for sale assets and liabilities are reported within the company’s Software segmen

Financial Assets & Liabilities:
Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The company classifies certain assets and liabilities based on the following fair value hierarchy:
•
Level 1
–
Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that can be accessed at the measurement date;
•
Level 2
–
Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•
Level 3
–
Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
21
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
When available, the company uses unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets to measure the fair value and classifies such items as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon internally developed models that use current market-based or independently sourced market parameters such as interest rates and currency rates. Items valued using internally generated models are classified according to the lowest level input or value driver that is significant to the valuation.
The determination of fair value considers various factors including interest rate yield curves and time value underlying the financial instruments. For derivatives and debt securities, the company uses a discounted cash flow analysis using discount rates commensurate with the duration of the instrument.
In determining the fair value of financial instruments, the company considers certain market valuation adjustments to the “base valuations” calculated using the methodologies described below for several parameters that market participants would consider in determining fair value:
•
Counterparty credit risk adjustments are applied to financial instruments, taking into account the actual credit risk of a counterparty as observed in the credit default swap market to determine the true fair value of such an instrument.
•
Credit risk adjustments are applied to reflect the company’s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the company’s own credit risk as observed in the credit default swap market.
The company holds investments primarily in time deposits, certificates of deposit, and U.S. government debt that are designated as available-for-sale. The primary objective of the company’s cash and debt investment portfolio is to protect principal by investing in very liquid investment securities with highly rated counterparties.
The company’s standard practice is to hold all of its debt security investments classified as available-for-sale until maturity.
No
impairments for credit losses and no material non-credit impairments were recorded for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Certain non-financial assets such as property, plant and equipment (PP&E), operating right-of-use assets, goodwill and intangible assets are also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The impairment models used for non-financial assets depend on the type of asset. There were no material impairments of non-financial assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Financial Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value
Short-Term Receivables and Payables
Short-term receivables (excluding the current portion of long-term receivables) and other investments are financial assets with carrying values that approximate fair value. Accounts payable, other accrued expenses and short-term debt (excluding the current portion of long-term debt) are financial liabilities with carrying values that approximate fair value. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, except for short-term debt which would be classified as Level 2.
Loans and Long-Term Receivables
Fair values are based on discounted future cash flows using current interest rates offered for similar loans to clients with similar credit ratings for the same remaining maturities. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value for loans and long-term receivables was immaterial. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
23
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
Long-Term Debt
Fair value of publicly traded long-term debt is based on quoted market prices for the identical liability when traded as an asset in an active market. For other long-term debt (including long-term finance lease liabilities) for which a quoted market price is not available, an expected present value technique that uses rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities is used to estimate fair value. The carrying amount of long-term debt was
$
52,929
million and $
50,121
million, and the estimated fair value was $
49,844
million
and $
48,284
million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, long-term debt (including the current portion) would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Financing Receivables:
Financing receivables primarily consist of client loan and installment payment receivables (loans), investment in sales-type and direct financing leases (collectively referred to as client financing receivables) and commercial financing receivables. Loans are provided primarily to clients to finance the purchase of IBM hardware, software and services. Payment terms on these financing arrangements are for terms generally up to
seven years
. Investment in sales-type and direct financing leases relate principally to the company’s Infrastructure products and are for terms generally up to
five years
. Commercial financing receivables, which consist of both held-for-investment and held-for-sale receivables, relate primarily to working capital financing for business partners and distributors of IBM products and services. Payment terms for working capital financing generally range from
30
to
60
days.
A summary of the components of the company’s financing receivables is presented as follows:
(1)
The carrying value of the receivables classified as held for sale approximates fair value.

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
The company has a long-standing practice of taking mitigation actions, in certain circumstances, to transfer credit risk to third parties. These actions may include credit insurance, financial guarantees, nonrecourse secured borrowings, transfers of receivables recorded as true sales in accordance with accounting guidance or sales of equipment under operating lease. Sale of receivables arrangements are also utilized in the normal course of business as part of the company’s cash and liquidity management.
Financing receivables pledged as collateral for secured borrowings were $
330
million and $
232
million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. These borrowings are included in note 12, “Borrowings.”
Transfer of Financial Assets
The company has an existing agreement with a third-party investor to sell IBM short-term commercial financing receivables on a revolving basis. This agreement previously allowed for sales up to $
3.0
billion. In December 2023, the company amended and renewed its agreement for a
one-year
term, which reduced the limit to $
1.3
billion in January 2024. In addition, the company enters into agreements with third-party financial institutions to sell certain of its client financing receivables, including both loan and lease receivables, for cash proceeds. There were no material client financing receivables transferred for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023.
The following table presents the total amount of commercial financing receivables transferred.
(1)
Of the total amount of commercial financing receivables sold and derecognized from the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the amounts presented remained uncollected from business partners as of June 30, 2024 and 2023.
The transfer of these receivables qualified as true sales and therefore reduced financing receivables. The cash proceeds from the sales are included in cash flows from operating activities. For the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, the net loss, including fees, associated with the transfer of commercial financial receivables was $
33
million and $
45
million, respectively, and is included in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Financing Receivables by Portfolio Segment
The following tables present the amortized cost basis for client financing receivables at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, further segmented by
three
classes: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) and Asia Pacific. The commercial financing receivables portfolio segment is excluded from the tables in the sections below as the receivables are short term in nature and the current estimated risk of loss and resulting impact to the company’s financial results are not material.

(2)
Of the amortized cost not accruing, there was a related allowance of $
99
million and $
106
million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Financing income recognized on these receivables was immaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Credit Quality Indicators
The company’s credit quality indicators, which are based on rating agency data, publicly available information and information provided by customers, are reviewed periodically based on the relative level of risk. The resulting indicators are a numerical rating system that maps to Moody’s Investors Service credit ratings as shown below. The company uses information provided by Moody’s, where available, as one of many inputs in its determination of customer credit ratings. The credit quality of the customer is evaluated based on these indicators and is assigned the same risk rating whether the receivable is a lease or a loan.

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
The following tables present the amortized cost basis for client financing receivables by credit quality indicator at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. Receivables with a credit quality indicator ranging from Aaa to Baa3 are considered investment grade. All others are considered non-investment grade. The credit quality indicators reflect mitigating credit enhancement actions taken by customers which reduce the risk to IBM. Gross write-offs by vintage year at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were not material.

Intangible Assets Including Goodwill:
Intangible Assets
The following tables present the company's intangible asset balances by major asset class.
(1)
Amounts as of June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 include a decrease in net intangible asset balances of $
76
million and an increase of $
50
million, respectively, due to foreign currency translation.
(2)
Other intangibles are primarily acquired proprietary and non-proprietary technology licenses, data, business processes, methodologies and systems.
The net carrying amount of intangible assets decreased $
786
million during the first six months of 2024, primarily due to intangible asset amortization, partially offset by additions of capitalized software and acquired intangibles. The aggregate intangible asset amortization expense was $
607
million and $
1,205
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, compared to $
556
million and $
1,104
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, respectively. During the six months ended June 30, 2024, the company retired $
405
million of fully amortized intangible assets, impacting both the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization by this amount.
The future amortization expense relating to intangible assets currently recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet was estimated to be the following at June 30, 2024:

The company’s indenture governing its debt securities and its various credit facilities each contain significant covenants which obligate the company to promptly pay principal and interest, limit the aggregate amount of secured indebtedness and sale and leaseback transactions to
10
percent of the company’s consolidated net tangible assets, and restrict the company’s ability to merge or consolidate unless certain conditions are met. The credit facilities also include a covenant on the company’s consolidated net interest expense ratio, which cannot be less than
2.20
to 1.0, as well as a cross default provision with respect to other defaulted indebtedness of at least $
500
million.
The company is in compliance with its debt covenants and provides periodic certifications to its lenders. The failure to comply with its debt covenants could constitute an event of default with respect to the debt to which such provisions apply. If certain events of default were to occur, the principal and interest on the debt to which such event of default applied would become immediately due and payable.
On February 5, 2024, IBM International Capital Pte. Ltd (IIC), a wholly owned finance subsidiary of the company, issued $
5.5
billion of U.S. dollar fixed rate notes (IIC Notes) in tranches with maturities ranging from
2
to
30
years and coupons ranging from
4.6
to
5.3
percent. These notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the company.
IIC is a 100 percent owned finance subsidiary of IBM, as described by the SEC in Rule 13-01(a)(4)(vi) of Regulation S-X, the primary purpose of which is to borrow money to be made available for the benefit of IBM and its affiliates. The IIC Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by IBM, and no other subsidiary of IBM guarantees the IIC Notes.
Pre-swap annual contractual obligations of long-term debt outstanding at June 30, 2024, were as follows:

Commitments:
The company’s extended lines of credit to third-party entities include unused amounts of $
1.4
billion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023. A portion of these amounts was available to the company’s business partners to support their working capital needs. In addition, the company has committed to provide future financing to its clients in connection with client purchase agreements for $
1.9
billion at both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
The company collectively evaluates the allowance for these arrangements using a provision methodology consistent with the portfolio of the commitments. Refer to note A, “Significant Accounting Policies,” in the company’s 2023 Annual Report for additional information.
The allowance for these commitments is recorded in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and was not material at June 30, 2024.
The company has applied the guidance requiring a guarantor to disclose certain types of guarantees, even if the likelihood of requiring the guarantor’s performance is remote.
The following is a description of arrangements in which the company is the guarantor.
The company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. Typically, these obligations arise in the context of contracts entered into by the company, under which the company customarily agrees to hold the party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations and covenants related to such matters as title to the assets sold, certain intellectual property rights, specified environmental matters, third-party performance of nonfinancial contractual obligations and certain income taxes. In each of these circumstances, payment by the company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, the procedures of which typically allow the company to challenge the other party’s claims. While indemnification provisions typically do not include a contractual maximum on the company’s payment, the company’s obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time and/or nature of claim, and in some instances, the company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the company.
It is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Historically, payments made by the company under these agreements have not had a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.
In addition, the company guarantees certain loans and financial commitments. The maximum potential future payment under these financial guarantees and the fair value of these guarantees recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was not material.
Changes in the company’s warranty liability for standard warranties, which are included in other accrued expenses and liabilities and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, and for extended warranty contracts, which are included in deferred income in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, are presented in the following tables.

Contingencies:
As a company with a substantial employee population and with clients in more than
175
countries, IBM is involved, either as plaintiff or defendant, in a variety of ongoing claims, demands, suits, investigations, tax matters and proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business. The company is a leader in the information technology industry and, as such, has been and will continue to be subject to claims challenging its IP rights and associated products and offerings, including claims of copyright and patent infringement and violations of trade secrets and other IP rights. In addition, the company enforces its own IP against infringement, through license negotiations, lawsuits or otherwise. Further, given the rapidly evolving external landscape of cybersecurity, AI, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and threat actors, the company and its clients have been and will continue to be subject to actions or proceedings in various jurisdictions. Also, as is typical for companies of IBM’s scope and scale, the company is party to actions and proceedings in various jurisdictions involving a wide range of labor and employment issues (including matters related to contested employment decisions, country-specific labor and employment laws, and the company’s pension, retirement and other benefit plans), as well as actions with respect to contracts, product liability, cybersecurity, data privacy, securities, foreign operations, competition law and environmental matters. These actions may be commenced by a number of different parties, including competitors, clients, current or former employees, government and regulatory agencies, stockholders and representatives of the locations in which the company does business. Some of the actions to which the company is party may involve particularly complex technical issues, and some actions may raise novel questions under the laws of the various jurisdictions in which these matters arise.
The company records a provision with respect to a claim, suit, investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Any recorded liabilities, including any changes to such liabilities for the quarter ended June 30, 2024 were not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
In accordance with the relevant accounting guidance, the company provides disclosures of matters for which the likelihood of material loss is at least reasonably possible. In addition, the company also discloses matters based on its consideration of other matters and qualitative factors, including the experience of other companies in the industry, and investor, customer and employee relations considerations.
With respect to certain of the claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed herein, the company believes at this time that the likelihood of any material loss is remote, given, for example, the procedural status, court rulings, and/or the strength of the company’s defenses in those matters. With respect to the remaining claims, suits, investigations and proceedings discussed in this note, except as specifically discussed herein, the company is unable to provide estimates of reasonably possible losses or range of losses, including losses in excess of amounts accrued, if any, for the following reasons. Claims, suits, investigations and proceedings are inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters. It is the company’s experience that damage amounts claimed in litigation against it are unreliable and unrelated to possible outcomes, and as such are not meaningful indicators of the company’s potential liability. Further, the company is unable to provide such an estimate due to a number of other factors with respect to these claims, suits, investigations and proceedings, including considerations of the procedural status of the matter in question, the presence of complex or novel legal theories, and/or the ongoing discovery and development of information important to the matters.
33
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
The company reviews claims, suits, investigations and proceedings at least quarterly, and decisions are made with respect to recording or adjusting provisions and disclosing reasonably possible losses or range of losses (individually or in the aggregate), to reflect the impact and status of settlement discussions, discovery, procedural and substantive rulings, reviews by counsel and other information pertinent to a particular matter.
Whether any losses, damages or remedies finally determined in any claim, suit, investigation or proceeding could reasonably have a material effect on the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will depend on a number of variables, including: the timing and amount of such losses or damages; the structure and type of any such remedies; the significance of the impact any such losses, damages or remedies may have in the Consolidated Financial Statements; and the unique facts and circumstances of the particular matter that may give rise to additional factors. While the company will continue to defend itself vigorously, it is possible that the company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these matters.
The following is a summary of the more significant legal matters involving the company.
On June 8, 2021, IBM sued GlobalFoundries U.S. Inc. (GF) in New York State Supreme Court for claims including fraud and breach of contract relating to a long-term strategic relationship between IBM and GF for researching, developing, and manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips for IBM. GF walked away from its obligations and IBM is now suing to recover amounts paid to GF, and other compensatory and punitive damages, totaling more than $
1.5
billion. On September 14, 2021, the court ruled on GF’s motion to dismiss. On April 7, 2022, the Appellate Division unanimously reversed the lower court’s dismissal of IBM’s fraud claim. IBM’s claims for breaches of contract, promissory estoppel, and fraud are proceeding.
On June 2, 2022, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that the IBM Pension Plan miscalculated certain joint and survivor annuity pension benefits by using outdated actuarial tables in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. IBM, the Plan Administrator Committee, and the IBM Pension Plan are named as defendants. On April 4, 2024, the court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice. On May 6, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed.
As disclosed in the Kyndryl Form 10 and subsequent Kyndryl public filings, in 2017 BMC Software, Inc. (BMC) filed suit against IBM in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas in a dispute involving IBM’s former managed infrastructure services business. On May 30, 2022, the trial court awarded BMC $
718
million in direct damages and $
718
million in punitive damages, plus interest and fees. On April 30, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed and rendered the district court’s judgment in IBM’s favor. IBM does not believe it has any material exposure relating to this litigation. No material liability or related indemnification asset has been recorded by IBM.
The company is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. federal or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as “Superfund,” or laws similar to CERCLA. Such statutes require potentially responsible parties to participate in remediation activities regardless of fault or ownership of sites. The company is also conducting environmental investigations, assessments or remediations at or in the vicinity of several current or former operating sites globally pursuant to permits, administrative orders or agreements with country, state or local environmental agencies, and is involved in lawsuits and claims concerning certain current or former operating sites.
The company is also subject to ongoing tax examinations and governmental assessments in various jurisdictions. Along with many other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the company is involved in various challenges with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments and non-income tax litigation matters. The total potential amount related to all these matters for all applicable years is approximately $
400
million. The company believes it will prevail on these matters and that this amount is not a meaningful indicator of
liability.

Derivative Financial Instruments:
The company operates in multiple functional currencies and is a significant lender and borrower in the global markets. In the normal course of business, the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations, and to a lesser extent equity and commodity price changes and client credit risk. The company limits these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures, including the use of derivatives, and, where cost effective, financing with debt in the currencies in which assets are denominated. For interest rate exposures, derivatives are used to better align rate movements between the interest rates associated with the company’s lease and other financial assets and the interest rates associated with its financing debt. Derivatives are also used to manage the related cost of debt. For foreign currency exposures, derivatives are used to better manage the cash flow volatility arising from foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
In the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the company does not offset derivative assets against liabilities in master netting arrangements nor does it offset receivables or payables recognized upon payment or receipt of cash collateral against the fair values of the related derivative instruments.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the amount recognized in other accounts receivables for the right to reclaim cash collateral was $
56
million and $
11
million, respectively. At June 30, 2024, there was no
amount recognized in accounts payable for the obligation to return cash collateral. At December 31, 2023, the amount recognized in accounts payable for such obligation was $
7
million.
The company restricts the use of cash collateral received to rehypothecation, and therefore reports it in restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
There was no
cash collateral rehypothecated at June 30, 2024. At December 31, 2023, the amount rehypothecated was $
7
million. Additionally, if derivative exposures covered by a qualifying master netting agreement had been netted in the Consolidated Balance Sheet at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total derivative asset and liability positions each would have been reduced by $
186
million and $
235
million, respectively.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
As discussed in note 5, “Acquisitions & Divestitures,” the company completed the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG on July 1, 2024. In December 2023, in connection with the announcement of the acquisition, the company entered into foreign exchange call option contracts (the call options) with a total notional amount of $
2.3
billion (€
2.13
billion) and a total premium paid of $
49
million. The call options were accounted for as non-hedge derivatives and expired on June 18, 2024 with no
economic value. The company replaced the majority of the options with foreign currency forward contracts with notional values of $
1.8
billion to cover the economic exposure from June 18, 2024 to June 28, 2024. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the company recorded a realized loss of $
18
million and $
68
million, respectively, in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At December 31, 2023, the fair value of the call options was $
62
million, and was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. There were no
associated derivatives outstanding at June 30, 2024.
In its hedging programs, the company may use forward contracts, futures contracts, interest-rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, equity swaps, and options depending upon the underlying exposure. The company is not a party to leveraged derivative instruments.
A brief description of the major hedging programs, categorized by underlying risk, follows.
Interest Rate Risk
Fixed and Variable Rate Borrowings
The company issues debt in the global capital markets to fund its operations and financing business. Access to cost-effective financing can result in interest rate mismatches with the underlying assets. To manage these mismatches and to reduce overall interest cost, the company may use interest-rate swaps to convert specific fixed-rate debt issuances into variable-rate debt (i.e., fair value hedges) and to convert specific variable-rate debt issuances into fixed-rate debt (i.e., cash flow hedges). At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of the company’s interest-rate swaps was $
6.7
billion. The weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023 was approximately
5.0
years and
5.5
years, respectively. These interest-rate contracts were accounted for as fair value hedges. The company did
not
have any cash flow hedges relating to this program outstanding at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
Forecasted Debt Issuance
The company is exposed to interest rate volatility on future debt issuances. To manage this risk, the company may use instruments such as forward starting interest-rate swaps to lock in the rate on the interest payments related to the forecasted debt issuances. There were
no
instruments outstanding at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023.
In connection with cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments related to the company's borrowings, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of $
113
million and $
121
million at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $
14
million of the deferred net losses (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2024 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying interest payments.
Foreign Exchange Risk
Long-Term Investments in Foreign Subsidiaries (Net Investment)
A large portion of the company’s foreign currency denominated debt portfolio is designated as a hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries to reduce the volatility in stockholders’ equity caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates in the functional currency of major foreign subsidiaries with respect to the U.S. dollar. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the carrying value of debt designated as hedging instruments was $
13.5
billion and $
15.9
billion, respectively. The company also uses foreign currency derivatives for this risk management purpose. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges was $
6.0
billion and $
4.9
billion, respectively. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately
0.2
years and
0.1
years, respectively.

Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
Anticipated Royalties and Cost Transactions
The company’s operations generate significant nonfunctional currency, third-party vendor payments and intercompany payments for royalties and goods and services among the company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries and with the company. In anticipation of these foreign currency cash flows and in view of the volatility of the currency markets, the company selectively employs foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its currency risk. These forward contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At June 30, 2024, the maximum remaining length of time over which the company hedged its exposure is approximately
two years
. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted royalty and cost transactions was $
9.6
billion and $
9.2
billion, respectively. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the weighted-average remaining maturity of these instruments was approximately
0.6
years.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with cash flow hedges of anticipated royalties and cost transactions, the company recorded net gains (before taxes) of $
312
million and $
40
million, respectively, in AOCI. The company estimates that $
251
million of deferred net gains (before taxes) on derivatives in AOCI at June 30, 2024 will be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months, providing an offsetting economic impact against the underlying anticipated transactions.
Foreign Currency Denominated Borrowings
The company is exposed to exchange rate volatility on foreign currency denominated debt. To manage this risk, the company may employ forward contracts or cross-currency swaps to convert the principal, or principal and interest payments of foreign currency denominated debt to debt denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing entity. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges. At June 30, 2024, the maximum length of time remaining over which the company hedged its exposure was approximately
seven years
. At both June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges of foreign-currency denominated debt was $
5.2
billion.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with previously terminated cross-currency swaps, the company recorded net losses (before taxes) of $
56
million and $
68
million, respectively, in AOCI, of which $
18
million of deferred net losses (before taxes) is estimated to be reclassified to net income within the next 12 months.
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, in connection with forward contracts, the company has recorded net gains (before taxes) of $
38
million and $
23
million, respectively, in AOCI. Approximately $
52
million of losses (before taxes) related to the initial forward points excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness is expected to be amortized to other (income) and expense within the next 12 months.
Subsidiary Cash and Foreign Currency Asset/Liability Management
The company uses its Global Treasury Centers to manage the cash of its subsidiaries. These centers principally use currency swaps to convert cash flows in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the company uses forward contracts to economically hedge, on a net basis, the foreign currency exposure of a portion of the company’s nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities. The terms of these forward and swap contracts are generally less than
one year
. The changes in the fair values of these contracts and of the underlying hedged exposures are generally offsetting and are recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of derivative instruments in economic hedges of foreign currency exposure was $
7.1
billion and $
6.7
billion, respectively.
Equity Risk Management
The company is exposed to market price changes in certain broad market indices and in the company’s own stock primarily related to certain obligations to employees. Changes in the overall value of these employee compensation obligations are recorded in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. Although not designated as accounting hedges, the company utilizes derivatives, including equity swaps and futures, to economically hedge the exposures related to its employee compensation obligations. The derivatives are linked to the total return on certain broad market indices or the total return on the company’s common stock, and are recorded at fair value with gains or losses also reported in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Income Statement. At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total notional amount of
41
Table of Contents
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
derivative instruments in economic hedges of these compensation obligations was $
1.4
billion and $
1.2
billion, respectively.
Cumulative Basis Adjustments for Fair Value Hedges
At June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the following amounts were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges:
(1)
Includes ($
177
) million and ($
200
) million of hedging adjustments on discontinued hedging relationships at June 30, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.
The Effect of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Income Statement
The total amounts of income and expense line items presented in the Consolidated Income Statement in which the effects of fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, net investment hedges and derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are recorded and the total effect of hedge activity on these income and expense line items are as follows:

The amount includes changes in clean fair values of the derivative instruments in fair value hedging relationships and the periodic accrual for coupon payments required under these derivative contracts.
(2)
The amount includes basis adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged item recorded during the period and amortization of basis adjustments recorded on de-designated hedging relationships during the period.
(3)
The company’s policy is to recognize all fair value changes in amounts excluded from effectiveness testing for net investment hedges in net income each period. For cash flow hedges of foreign currency denominated debt, the amounts excluded from effectiveness testing are amortized to net income over the life of the hedging instrument.

Stock-Based Compensation:
Stock-based compensation cost for stock awards and stock options is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized over the employee requisite service period.
The following table presents total stock-based compensation cost included in income from continuing operations.
Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the three months ended June 30, 2024 increased $
28
million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to increases in restricted stock units ($
14
million), performance share units ($
6
million), stock options ($
5
million) and Employees Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) ($
3
million). The increases are primarily driven by stock-based compensation awards granted by the company as part of its annual cycles for executives and other employees.
Pre-tax stock-based compensation cost for the six months ended June 30, 2024 increased $
79
million compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to increases in restricted stock units ($
42
million), performance share units ($
21
million), stock options ($
13
million) and ESPP ($
4
million). The increases are primarily driven by stock-based compensation awards granted by the company as part of its annual cycles for executives and other employees.
Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at June 30, 2024 was $
1.7
billion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately
2.4
years.
18.
Retirement-Related Benefits:
The company offers defined benefit (DB) pension plans, defined contribution plans, as well as nonpension postretirement plans primarily consisting of retiree medical benefits.
IBM U.S. Retirement Plan Changes
Effective January 1, 2024, IBM changed how it provides certain retirement-related benefits in the U.S. IBM is providing a new benefit to most U.S. employees under its existing U.S. Qualified Personal Pension Plan (Qualified PPP) called the Retirement Benefit Account (RBA). This is in place of any IBM contributions to the U.S. employees' 401(k) Plus accounts. IBM U.S. regular full-time and part-time employees with at least
one year
of service will participate in the RBA. Each eligible employee's RBA is credited monthly with an amount equal to
five
percent of their eligible pay with no employee contribution required. Under the RBA, eligible employees earn
six
percent interest through 2026 and starting in 2027, will earn interest equal to the 10-year U.S. Treasury Yield, subject to a
three
percent minimum per year through 2033. Eligible employees also received a salary increase effective January 1, 2024 for the difference between the IBM 401(k) Plus contribution percent they were previously entitled to receive and the
five
percent RBA pay credit. Since the RBA is a component of the Qualified PPP, it is funded by the trust for the Qualified PPP along with all other benefits in the Qualified PPP.
As a result of this change, inactive pension plan participants no longer represent substantially all of the participants in the Qualified PPP. As required by U.S. GAAP, this changed the amortization period of unrecognized actuarial losses from the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants to the average remaining service period of active plan
45

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (continued)
participants in 2024. Recognized actuarial losses for the U.S. Plans increased by approximately $
100
million and $
200
million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, respectively, as compared to the prior-year periods, primarily driven by the change in amortization period. There was no impact to funded status, retiree benefit payments or funding requirements of the Qualified PPP due to the change in amortization period.
The following tables provide the pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.
Cost/(Income) of Retirement Plans
The following tables provide the components of the cost/(income) for the company’s retirement-related benefit plans.

390
million and $
347
million of U.S. Treasury securities, respectively, to the Active Medical Trust.
Contributions made with U.S. Treasury securities are considered a non-cash transaction.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION
FOR THE THREE AND SIX MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2024
Snapshot
Organization of Information:
In the first quarter of 2024, we made changes to our organizational structure and management system to better align our portfolio to the market, increase transparency and improve segment comparability to peers. These changes did not impact our Consolidated Financial Statements, but did impact our reportable segments. The segments are reported on a comparable basis for all periods. In addition, due to the removal of certain components of segment profitability we also updated the title of our segment performance metric from pre-tax income from continuing operations to segment profit. Refer to note 4, "Segments," for additional information on our reportable segments.
Within the tables presented, certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers for disclosure purposes. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. This is annotated where applicable.
Currency
:
The references to “adjusted for currency” or “at constant currency” in the Management Discussion do not include operational impacts that could result from fluctuations in foreign currency rates. When we refer to growth rates at constant currency or adjust such growth rates for currency, it is done so that certain financial results can be viewed without the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, thereby facilitating period-to-period comparisons of its business performance. Financial results adjusted for currency are calculated by translating current period activity in local currency using the comparable prior-year period’s currency conversion rate. This approach is used for countries where the functional currency is the local currency. Generally, when the dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies, the growth at constant currency rates or adjusting for currency will be higher or lower than growth reported at actual exchange rates. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations” for additional information.
Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings:
In an effort to provide better transparency into the operational results of the business, supplementally, management separates business results into operating and non-operating categories. Operating earnings from continuing operations is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the effects of certain acquisition-related charges, intangible asset amortization, expense resulting from basis differences on equity method investments, retirement-related costs and their related tax impacts. Due to the unique, non-recurring nature of the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. tax reform), management characterizes the one-time provisional charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 and adjustments to that charge as non-operating. Adjustments primarily include true-ups, accounting elections and any changes to regulations, laws or audit adjustments that affect the recorded one-time charge. For acquisitions, operating (non-GAAP) earnings exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets and acquisition-related charges such as in-process research and development, transaction costs, applicable retention, restructuring and related expenses, tax charges related to acquisition integration and pre-closing charges, such as financing costs. These charges are excluded as they may be inconsistent in amount and timing from period to period and are significantly impacted by the size, type and frequency of our acquisitions. Given its unique and temporary nature, management has also characterized as non-operating expense, the mark-to-market impact on the foreign exchange derivative contracts entered into prior to the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from SoftwareAG to economically hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the purchase price of this acquisition. These derivative contracts expired by June 28, 2024. This impact was recorded in other (income) and expense in the Consolidated Income Statement and reflects the realized loss from the changes in fair value of these derivative contracts. All other spending for acquired companies is included in both earnings from continuing operations and in operating (non-GAAP) earnings. For retirement-related costs, management characterizes certain items as operating and others as non-operating, consistent with GAAP. We include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan service costs, multi-employer plan costs and the cost of defined contribution plans in operating earnings. Non-operating retirement-related costs include defined benefit plan and nonpension postretirement benefit plan amortization of prior service costs, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortized actuarial gains/losses, the impacts of any plan curtailments/settlements and

pension insolvency costs and other costs. Non-operating retirement-related costs are primarily related to changes in pension plan assets and liabilities which are tied to financial market performance, and we consider these costs to be outside of the operational performance of the business.
Overall, management believes that supplementally providing investors with a view of operating earnings as described above provides increased transparency and clarity into both the operational results of the business and the performance of our pension plans; improves visibility to management decisions and their impacts on operational performance; enables better comparison to peer companies; and allows us to provide a long-term strategic view of the business going forward. In addition, these non-GAAP measures provide a perspective consistent with areas of interest we routinely receive from investors and analysts. Our reportable segment financial results reflect pre-tax operating earnings from continuing operations, consistent with our management and measurement system.

Macroeconomic Environment:
Our business portfolio positions us well in challenging macroeconomic times. Our diversification across geographies, industries, clients and business mix and our recurring revenue base provides some stability in revenue, profit and cash generation. Clients and partners continue to leverage technology to allow businesses to scale, drive efficiencies, fuel growth and gain competitive advantage. The short-term uncertainty caused by interest rates and inflation is leading clients to manage their discretionary spending, but the overall macroeconomic outlook for technology spending remains positive.
In the first six months of 2024, movements in global currencies continued to impact our reported year-to-year revenue and profit. We execute hedging programs which defer, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency. The (gains)/losses from these hedging programs are reflected primarily in other income and expense. Refer to “Currency Rate Fluctuations,” for additional information.
Financial Performance Summary — Three Months Ended June 30:
In the second quarter of 2024, we reported $15.8 billion in revenue, income from continuing operations of $1.8 billion and operating (non-GAAP) earnings of $2.3 billion. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $1.96 as reported and $2.43 on an operating (non-GAAP) basis. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and $2.6 billion in free cash flow, and delivered shareholder returns of $1.5 billion in dividends. Our second-quarter performance reflects solid revenue growth and cash flow generation, demonstrating the continued success of our hybrid cloud and AI strategy, and the strength of our diversified business model. We continued to focus on the fundamentals of our business which, combined with our cash generation, position us to continue investing in innovation and expertise across the portfolio while continuing to return value to shareholders through dividends.

Second Quarter in Review
Results of Continuing Operations
Segment Details
As discussed in the "Organization of Information" section, we made changes to our organizational structure and management system in the first quarter of 2024. With these changes, we revised our reportable segments and updated the title of our segment performance metric from pre-tax income from continuing operations to segment profit.
The following tables present each reportable segment’s revenue and gross margin results, followed by an analysis of the second quarter and first six months of 2024 versus the second quarter and first six months of 2023 reportable segments results. Prior-year results have been recast to reflect the January 2024 segment changes as described in note 4, "Segments."

Software revenue of $6,739 million increased 7.1 percent as reported (8.4 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven by solid revenue growth in both Hybrid Platform & Solutions and Transaction Processing. We had strong transactional performance as clients leverage the capabilities of our AI and hybrid cloud platforms. This revenue performance also reflects the investments we have been making in Software, both organically and in acquisitions.
Hybrid Platform & Solutions revenue of $4,575 million increased 5.2 percent as reported (6.3 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven primarily by growth in Red Hat and Automation. Red Hat revenue increased 6.9 percent as reported (8.1 percent adjusted for currency), with double-digit growth in OpenShift and Ansible, and solid growth in RHEL in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The revenue growth within Red Hat reflects the demand for our hybrid cloud solutions, including application modernization, management automation, generative AI and virtualization. Automation revenue increased 14.6 percent as reported (15.9 percent adjusted for currency), driven by strong growth in our Software-as-a-Service subscription offerings such as AIOps and Management, which includes the revenue contribution from the Apptio acquisition which closed in the third quarter of 2023. The synergy between Apptio's FinOps offerings and our broader automation portfolio helps clients manage, optimize and automate technology spending decisions. Data & AI revenue decreased 3.0 percent as reported (2.1 percent adjusted for currency), due to a challenging year-to-year revenue performance comparison where we had strong, broad-based, double-digit revenue growth in the second quarter of 2023.
Across Hybrid Platform & Solutions, our annual recurring revenue (ARR) was $14.1 billion. ARR is a key performance metric management uses to assess the health and growth trajectory of our Hybrid Platform & Solutions business within the Software segment. The metric was updated in the first quarter of 2024 to reflect the organizational changes described in note 4, “Segments,” and to simplify the calculation. ARR is calculated by using the current quarter’s recurring revenue and then multiplying that value by four. This value includes the following consumption models: (1) software subscription agreements, including committed term licenses, (2) as-a-service arrangements such as SaaS and PaaS, and (3) maintenance and support contracts. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue as this performance metric and its inputs may not represent revenue that will be recognized in future periods.
Transaction Processing revenue of $2,164 million increased 11.4 percent as reported (13.0 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, reflecting continued revenue growth in both recurring and transactional software. This growth reflects the innovation and value of our mission-critical hardware stack across IBM Z, Power and Storage systems. The performance is the result of the combination of clients' growing demand for capacity, solid renewal rates, and strong large deal performance. In addition, our new generative AI portfolio innovation, watsonx Code Assistant for Z, is resonating well with clients.
For the first six months of 2024, Software revenue of $12,637 million increased 6.3 percent as reported (7.2 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the same period in 2023, driven by solid growth in Hybrid Platform & Solutions, led by Red Hat and Automation, and Transaction Processing. This performance reflects the continued demand for the high-value capabilities within our Hybrid Platform & Solutions offerings and the value of our mission-critical software within Transaction Processing.

Software gross profit margin increased 1.5 points to 83.6 percent in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Segment profit of $2,113 million increased 20.8 percent and segment profit margin of 31.3 percent increased 3.6 points compared to the prior-year period. The segment profit growth reflects our operating leverage driven by our revenue performance and portfolio mix. The benefits of our continued productivity actions, partially offset by key investments in software innovation, also contributed to segment profit and margin expansion.
For the first six months of 2024, gross profit margin increased 0.7 points to 83.0 percent, compared to the first six months of 2023. Segment profit of $3,612 million increased 15.5 percent and segment profit margin of 28.6 percent increased 2.3 points compared to the prior-year period. The segment profit growth for the first half of 2024 was driven by the same factors described for the second quarter. The segment profit margin also included about half of a point of impact from currency.

Recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes.
Consulting revenue of $5,179 million decreased 0.9 percent as reported, but increased 1.8 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. We continued to have solid demand for our large transformational offerings as clients continue to prioritize driving productivity with AI and analytics. At the same time, consistent with the first quarter, we continued to see clients delay discretionary projects as they prioritized their spending. Our extensive industry and domain expertise has placed us in an early leadership role at the onset of the technology shift to generative AI. We are partnering with our clients to design and scale AI solutions by leveraging our AI capabilities and the AI capabilities of our strategic partners. We are utilizing generative AI solutions to improve delivery by developing new ways of working and driving productivity within our client contracts. Generative AI is driving the next wave of growth, acting as a catalyst for companies to grow revenue, cut costs and change the way they work. This is creating a significant opportunity for IBM, as we have both technology and consulting, which is a unique and powerful combination to help clients navigate this technology shift. In human capital businesses, we are seeing clients re-prioritize their spend on this technology transition, and there is some potential for the total addressable market to expand.
In the second quarter of 2024, Business Transformation revenue of $2,360 million increased 2.8 percent as reported (5.5 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period, led by finance and supply chain transformations. Data transformation offerings also contributed to revenue growth in the quarter.
Technology Consulting revenue of $917 million decreased 2.5 percent as reported, but grew 0.5 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven by growth in application modernization services.
Application Operations revenue of $1,902 million decreased 4.5 percent as reported (1.8 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period, reflecting a decline in on-premise custom application management projects, partially offset by growth in cloud-based application management offerings.
For the first six months of 2024, Consulting revenue of $10,365 million decreased 0.6 percent as reported, but grew 1.8 percent adjusted for currency, led by strength in our Business Transformation offerings. Business Transformation revenue grew year to year led by finance and supply chain, data and technology, and customer experience transformation projects. In our Technology Consulting business, revenue declined as reported, but grew adjusted for currency. We had declines in on-premise and cloud application development, but growth in client engagements focused on cloud modernization. Within Application Operations, we had declines in on-premise application management services, partially offset by growth in cloud application management services.

In the second quarter of 2024, Consulting gross profit margin of 26.3 percent increased 0.4 points on a year-to-year basis. Segment profit of $463 million decreased 4.0 percent and segment profit margin of 8.9 percent decreased 0.3 points year to year. The gross profit margin expansion was driven by productivity and pricing actions we have taken, partially offset by continued labor inflation which is also reflected in the modest decline in segment profit margin.
For the first six months of 2024, Consulting gross profit margin of 25.8 percent increased 0.1 points compared to the prior-year period. Segment profit of $888 million decreased 2.4 percent and segment profit margin of 8.6 percent decreased 0.2 points in the first six months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. The six-month margin performance was driven by the same factors as described above for the second quarter. The segment profit margin also included about half of a point of impact from currency.
Consulting Signings and Book-to-Bill

Recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes.
In the second quarter of 2024, Consulting signings decreased 4.5 percent as reported and 2.5 percent adjusted for currency. While discretionary spending constraints impacted our small engagement performance in the second-quarter 2024, we had solid demand for large engagements across finance and supply chain transformation, cloud modernization and application development. Our book-to-bill ratio for the trailing twelve-months remains over 1.15. Book-to-bill represents the ratio of IBM Consulting signings to its revenue over the same period. The metric is a useful indicator of the demand of our business over time.

Signings are management’s initial estimate of the value of a client’s commitment under a services contract within IBM Consulting. There are no third-party standards or requirements governing the calculation of signings. The calculation used by management involves estimates and judgments to gauge the extent of a client’s commitment, including the type and duration of the agreement, and the presence of termination charges or wind-down costs.
Contract extensions and increases in scope are treated as signings only to the extent of the incremental new value. Total signings can vary over time due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, the timing of signing a small number of larger contracts. Signings associated with an acquisition will be recognized on a prospective basis.
Management believes the estimated values of signings disclosed provide an indication of our forward-looking revenue. Signings are used to monitor the performance of the business and viewed as useful information for management and shareholders. The conversion of signings into revenue may vary based on the types of services and solutions, contract duration, customer decisions, and other factors, which may include, but are not limited to, the macroeconomic environment.
Infrastructure
Infrastructure revenue of $3,645 million increased 0.7 percent as reported and 2.7 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, with strong growth in Hybrid Infrastructure, partially offset by a decline in Infrastructure Support.
Hybrid Infrastructure revenue of $2,360 million increased 4.4 percent as reported and 6.1 percent adjusted for currency in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, we had strong and broad-based revenue growth across our hardware platforms, led by IBM Z which increased 6.0 percent as reported and 7.6 percent adjusted for currency. We are now more than two years into the z16 cycle and the revenue performance continues to outperform prior cycles. Our clients have increasing demands for workloads given rapid business expansion, the complex regulatory environment and increasing cybersecurity threats and attacks. IBM Z addresses these client needs with the combination of cloud-native development for hybrid cloud, embedded AI at scale, quantum-safe security, energy efficiency and strong reliability and scalability. IBM Z remains an enduring platform for mission-critical workloads, driving both hardware and related software, storage and services adoption. Distributed Infrastructure revenue increased 3.3 percent as reported and 5.0 percent adjusted for currency, driven primarily by strong growth in Power and Storage systems. Within Power, revenue growth was driven by demand for data intensive workloads on Power10, led by SAP Hana. Storage revenue performance was driven by growth in high-end storage tied to the z16 cycle and solutions tailored to protect, manage and access data for scaling generative AI.

Infrastructure Support revenue of $1,285 million decreased 5.4 percent as reported (2.9 percent adjusted for currency) in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, driven by volume decline in support of non-IBM equipment and IBM product cycle dynamics.
For the first six months of 2024, Infrastructure revenue of $6,721 million was flat as reported and increased 1.5 percent adjusted for currency compared to the prior-year period, driven by year-to-year growth in Hybrid Infrastructure partially offset by declines in Infrastructure Support. Within Hybrid Infrastructure, we had solid revenue growth in IBM Z and strong growth in Power and Storage systems within Distributed Infrastructure. The revenue decline in Infrastructure Support for the first six months of 2024 was driven by the same dynamics as the second quarter.

Recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes.
Infrastructure gross profit margin of 56.5 percent increased 0.5 points in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the prior-year period, with solid margin expansion in Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. The increase in margin within Hybrid Infrastructure was driven primarily by margin expansion within Distributed Infrastructure, driven by Power systems, and portfolio mix to IBM Z. In the second quarter of 2024, Infrastructure segment profit of $654 million decreased 10.7 percent and segment profit margin of 17.9 percent decreased 2.3 points compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year decrease in segment profit and margin reflects key investments we are making in the business across areas such as AI, hybrid cloud and quantum, partially offset by the benefits from productivity actions we have taken. The segment profit margin included approximately 1 point of impact from currency.
For the first six months of 2024, gross profit margin of 55.4 percent increased 1.4 points compared to the prior-year period, driven by margin expansion in Hybrid Infrastructure and Infrastructure Support. Infrastructure profit of $965 million decreased 7.1 percent and segment profit margin of 14.4 percent decreased 1.1 points in the first six months of 2024 compared to the prior-year period. This performance reflects the same factors described in the second-quarter performance, which were partially offset by higher IP and custom development income year to year. The segment profit margin also included approximately 1 point of impact from currency.

Total other (income) and expense was income of $233 million in the second quarter of 2024 and decreased $28 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:
•
Higher non-operating retirement-related cost of $97 million primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses of the Qualified PPP due to the change in amortization period as described in note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," partially offset by lower interest costs; partially offset by
•
Higher gains on land/building dispositions and sale of intangibles ($54 million) included in “Other”; and
•
Higher interest income ($15 million) primarily driven by a higher average cash balance in the current year.
Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was income of $349 million in the second quarter of 2024 and increased $87 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the factors described above, excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.
Total other (income) and expense was income of $550 million in the first six months of 2024 and increased $44 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by:
•
Higher gains on divestitures ($214 million) primarily driven by the divestiture of The Weather Company assets (included in “Other” in the table above). Refer to note 5, "Acquisitions & Divestitures," for additional information; and
•

Operating (non-GAAP) other (income) and expense was income of $812 million in the first six months of 2024 and increased $308 million compared to the prior-year period. The year-to-year change was primarily driven by the factors described above, excluding the higher non-operating retirement-related costs.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased $4 million and $69 million year to year in the second quarter and first six months of 2024, respectively. Interest expense is presented in cost of financing in the Consolidated Income Statement if the related external borrowings are to support the Financing external business. Overall interest expense (excluding capitalized interest) for the second quarter and first six months of 2024 was $509 million and $1,026 million, respectively, an increase of $3 million and $63 million, respectively, compared to the prior-year periods. The year-to-year dynamics for both the second quarter and first six months of 2024 were primarily driven by higher average interest rates and a higher average debt balance in the
current year.
Retirement-Related Plans
The following tables provide the total pre-tax cost for all retirement-related plans.

Total pre-tax retirement-related plan cost increased by $58 million compared to the second quarter of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($128 million) and higher service cost ($95 million), partially offset by lower cost of defined contribution plans ($134 million) and lower interest costs ($49 million). Total cost for the first six months of 2024 increased by $98 million compared to the first six months of 2023, primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses ($257 million) and higher service cost ($192 million), partially offset by lower cost of defined contribution plans ($292 million) and lower interest costs ($90 million).
As described in the “Operating (non-GAAP) Earnings” section, management characterizes certain retirement-related costs as operating and others as non-operating. Utilizing this characterization, operating retirement-related costs in the second quarter of 2024 were $252 million, a decrease of $38 million compared to the second quarter of 2023. The decrease was primarily driven by lower cost of defined contribution plans ($134 million), partially offset by higher service cost ($95 million) due to the U.S. retirement plan changes. For the first six months of 2024, operating retirement-related costs were $510 million, a decrease of $100 million compared to the prior-year period, primarily driven by lower cost of defined contribution plans ($292 million), partially offset by higher service cost ($192 million) due to U.S. retirement plan changes. Including the related employee salary increase effective January 1, 2024, the net impact to our operating costs from the U.S. retirement plan changes was immaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2024. Refer to note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," for additional information. Non-operating costs/(income) of $98 million in the second quarter of 2024 increased $97 million year to year and for the first six months of 2024 was $194 million of cost compared to $4 million of income in the prior-year period. The year-to-year changes were primarily driven by an increase in recognized actuarial losses, due to the change in amortization period of the Qualified PPP as described in note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits," partially offset by lower interest cost

Taxes
The continuing operations provision for income taxes in the second quarter of 2024 was $389 million, compared to $419 million in the second quarter of 2023. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes in the second quarter of 2024 was $516 million, compared to $393 million in the second quarter of 2023.
The continuing operations benefit from income taxes in the first six months of 2024 was $112 million, compared to a provision for income taxes of $543 million in the first six months of 2023. The benefit from income taxes in the first six months of 2024 was primarily driven by the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter. The operating (non-GAAP) provision for income taxes in the first six months of 2024 was $610 million, compared to $593 million in the first six months of 2023.

IBM’s tax provision and effective tax rate are impacted by recurring factors including the geographical mix of income before taxes, incentives, changes in unrecognized tax benefits and discrete tax events, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in or new interpretations of tax laws. The GAAP tax provision and effective tax rate could also be affected by adjustments to the previously recorded charges for U.S. tax reform attributable to any changes in law, new regulations and guidance, and audit adjustments, among others.
During the fourth quarter of 2020, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) concluded its examination of the company’s U.S. income tax returns for 2013 and 2014 and issued a final Revenue Agent’s Report (RAR) proposing adjustments related to certain cross-border transactions that occurred in 2013. The company filed its IRS Appeals protest in the first quarter of 2021, and in October of 2023, the IRS issued a revised RAR. These adjustments, if sustained, would increase the company’s income subject to tax by approximately $4.2 billion, with tax calculated at the relevant federal income tax rate. The company continues to strongly disagree with the IRS position and will pursue resolution at IRS Appeals and then court, if necessary. In the first quarter of 2024, the IRS concluded its examination of the company's U.S. income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 and issued a final RAR proposing adjustments related to certain cross-border transactions that occurred in 2015. The proposed adjustments, if sustained, would increase the company’s income subject to tax by approximately $1.2 billion, with tax calculated at the relevant federal income tax rate. The company strongly disagrees with the IRS position and filed its IRS Appeals protest in the second quarter of 2024. In the fourth quarter of 2021, the IRS commenced its audit of the company’s U.S. tax returns for 2017 and 2018. The company anticipates that this audit will be completed in 2024. With respect to major U.S. state and foreign taxing jurisdictions, the company is generally no longer subject to tax examinations for years prior to 2016. The company is no longer subject to income tax examination of its U.S. federal tax return for years prior to 2013. The open years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as it relates to the amount and/or timing of income, deductions, and tax credits. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
The company is involved in a number of income tax-related matters in India challenging tax assessments issued by the India Tax Authorities. As of June 30, 2024, the company had recorded $584 million as prepaid income taxes in India. A significant portion of this balance represents cash tax deposits paid over time to protect the company’s right to appeal various income tax assessments made by the India Tax Authorities. Although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain, the company believes that adequate amounts of tax, interest and penalties have been provided for any adjustments that are expected to result for these years.
The amount of unrecognized tax benefits at June 30, 2024 is $8,398 million which can be reduced by $595 million associated with timing adjustments, potential transfer pricing adjustments, and state income taxes. The net amount of $7,803 million, if recognized, would favorably affect the company’s
effective tax rate.
Financial Position
Dynamics
Our balance sheet at June 30, 2024 continues to provide us with financial flexibility to support and invest in the business.
Cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities at June 30, 2024 were $15,959 million, an increase of $2,497 million compared to December 31, 2023, including restricted cash held in escrow in connection with the acquisition of StreamSets and webMethods from Software AG which was remitted on July 1, 2024. Total debt of $56,531 million at June 30, 2024 was flat compared to December 31, 2023. We continue to manage our debt levels while being acquisitive and without sacrificing investments in our business.
In the first six months of 2024, we generated $6,234 million in cash from operating activities, a decrease of $179 million compared to the first six months of 2023. Our free cash flow for the six months ended June 30, 2024 was $4,522 million, an increase of $1,081 million versus the prior year. Refer to pages
76
through
77
for additional information on free cash flow. Our cash generation enables us to continue investing in innovation and expertise across the portfolio, while returning value to shareholders through dividends. We returned $3,058 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of 2024.
Our pension plans were well funded at the end of 2023, with worldwide qualified plans funded at 111 percent. Overall pension funded status as of the end of June 2024 was fairly consistent with year-end 2023. We expect contributions for all

retirement-related plans to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2024, a decrease of approximately $0.3 billion compared to 2023.
IBM Working Capital
Working capital increased $4,865 million from the year-end 2023 position. Current assets increased $391 million ($1,097 million adjusted for currency) primarily in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities; partially offset by a decrease in receivables mainly from collections of seasonally higher year-end balances. Current liabilities decreased $4,474 million ($3,808 million adjusted for currency) due to declines in short-term debt mainly due to maturities, taxes payable, and accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in deferred income.

Excluding receivables classified as held for sale, the total IBM receivables provision coverage was 1.7 percent at June 30, 2024, a decrease of 50 basis points compared to December 31, 2023. The decrease in coverage is due to declines in reserves primarily driven by write-offs; partially offset by the overall decrease in total receivables. The write-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2024 were primarily driven by receivables from discontinued operations which had been previously reserved and were written off in the first quarter. Refer to Financing's "Financial Position" on page
79
for additional details regarding the Financing segment receivables and allowances.
Noncurrent Assets and Liabilities
The decrease in noncurrent assets of $1,785 million ($559 million adjusted for currency) is primarily due to a decrease in intangible assets driven by amortization.
Long-term debt increased $2,808 million ($3,411 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by our first-quarter debt issuances; partially offset by reclassifications to short-term debt to reflect upcoming maturities.
Noncurrent liabilities (excluding debt) decreased $1,217 million ($571 million adjusted for currency) primarily driven by a decrease in income tax reserves from the resolution of certain tax audit matters in the first quarter and a decrease in retirement and nonpension postretirement benefit obligations.

Debt
Our funding requirements are continually monitored as we execute our strategies to manage the overall asset and liability profile. Additionally, we maintain sufficient flexibility to access global funding sources as needed.
(1)
Refer to Financing’s “Financial Position” on page
79
for additional details.
Total debt of $56,531 million decreased $16 million (increased $607 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by maturities of $5,224 million and currency impacts; partially offset by proceeds from issuances of $5,705 million.
Non-Financing debt of $45,420 million increased $752 million ($1,201 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily due to first-quarter debt issuances; partially offset by maturities.
Financing segment debt of $11,112 million decreased $768 million ($594 million adjusted for currency) from December 31, 2023, primarily due to lower funding requirements associated with financing receivables.
Financing provides financing solutions predominantly for IBM’s external client assets, and the debt used to fund Financing assets is primarily composed of intercompany loans. Total debt changes generally correspond with the level of client and commercial financing receivables, the level of cash and cash equivalents, the change in intercompany and external payables and the change in intercompany investment from IBM. The terms of the intercompany loans are set by the company to substantially match the term, currency and interest rate variability underlying the financing receivable. The Financing debt-to-equity ratio remained at 9.0 to 1 at June 30, 2024.
I
nterest expense relating to debt supporting Financing’s external client and internal business is included in the “Financing Results of Operations” and in note 4, “Segments.” In the Consolidated Income Statement, the external debt-related interest expense supporting Financing’s internal financing to the company is classified as interest expense.
Equity
Total equity increased $1,490 million from December 31, 2023, primarily driven by an increase from net income of $3,439 million and common stock of $858 million; partially offset by dividends paid of $3,058 million.
Cash Flow
Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows on page

73
Table of Contents
Management Discussion – (continued)
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $179 million as compared to the first six months of 2023. This was due to a decrease in cash provided by financing receivables; partially offset by performance-related improvements within net income. Changes in operating assets and liabilities, net of acquisitions/divestitures in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows also includes the reduction of tax reserves mainly in the first-quarter 2024 which is reflected as a non-cash adjustment to reconcile net income/(loss) to cash from operating activities.
Net cash used in investing activities decreased $5,982 million mainly driven by a decrease in net cash used in marketable securities and other investments and an increase in cash provided by divestitures from the sale of The Weather Company assets in the first quarter of 2024.
Financing activities were a net use of cash of $2,638 million in the first six months of 2024 compared to a net source of cash of $2,978 million in the first six months of 2023 primarily driven by a lower level of net debt issuances in the
current-
year period.
Looking Forward
Technology has proven to be a fundamental source of competitive advantage. Continued demand for technology will serve as a major driving force behind global economic and business growth as businesses look to scale, offer better services, drive efficiencies and seize new market opportunities. AI-driven productivity, in particular, continues to be a top priority for businesses for both cost reductions and new revenue opportunities.
Enterprise AI continues to gain traction. In 2024, we anticipate more clients moving from experimenting to deploying AI at scale to unlock productivity. We believe our comprehensive AI strategy is well positioned to help clients scale AI. It has been a year since we introduced watsonx and our generative AI strategy to the market. We have infused AI across the business. From the tools clients use to manage and optimize their hybrid cloud environments, to our platform products across watsonx.ai, .data and .gov, to Infrastructure and Consulting, you can find AI innovation in all of our segments. For example, in Software, our broad suite of automation products such as Apptio and watsonx Orchestrate are leveraging AI. Red Hat is bringing AI to the platform with innovation such as OpenShift AI and RHEL AI. In Transaction Processing we are experiencing early momentum in watsonx Code Assistant for Z. In Infrastructure, IBM Z is equipped with real time AI inferencing capabilities. In Consulting, our experts are helping clients design and implement AI strategies and are also leveraging AI technologies in the delivery of those services.
We are committed to an open innovation ecosystem around AI, to help our clients maximize flexibility and leverage skills and IBM with Red Hat can be a key driver of open-source AI. We recently announced that we open-sourced IBM’s Granite family of large language models and we see parallels to how Linux became dominant in the enterprise server space as a result of the speed and innovation offered by open source. Red Hat and IBM also launched InstructLab to evolve and improve AI models. Our partner ecosystem remains essential to both AI and hybrid cloud growth and we continue to progress strategic partnerships with industry leaders. In May, IBM and Palo Alto Networks announced a partnership to deliver AI-powered security solutions using watsonx. As part of this, Palo Alto is acquiring certain IBM QRadar SaaS assets, and we are partnering to offer seamless migration for QRadar customers to XSIAM. The cash proceeds from the sale of QRadar SaaS assets will be reflected in free cash flow, as they will be included in cash from investing activities within proceeds from disposition of PP&E, other, in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. These proceeds are expected to be largely offset by structural actions to address stranded costs, representing a modest net benefit to free cash flow in the second half of 2024. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.
We continue to invest in emerging technologies, bringing new innovations to market. In early April 2024, we installed a Quantum System One, the first IBM quantum system on a college campus anywhere in the world. This installation will advance research in critical areas such as energy, storage, materials science and financial modeling. As we remain focused on portfolio optimization, we closed the sale of The Weather Company assets in January. To complement our portfolio, we completed four acquisitions in the first half of 2024, and on July 1, 2024, we completed the acquisition of the StreamSets and webMethods assets from Software AG. This acquisition brings together leading capabilities in integration, API management and data ingestion.
On April 24, 2024, we announced our intent to acquire all of the outstanding shares of HashiCorp. The combination of IBM’s and HashiCorp’s combined portfolios will help clients manage growing application and infrastructure complexity and create a comprehensive end-to-end hybrid cloud platform designed for the AI era. Under the terms of the definitive agreement, HashiCorp shareholders on record immediately prior to the effective time on the closing date will receive $35

per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $6.4 billion. On July 15, 2024, HashiCorp stockholders voted to approve the merger with IBM. The transaction is expected to close by the end of 2024, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Upon closing, HashiCorp will be integrated into the Software segment.
In the first six months of 2024, we continued to invest organically and inorganically, bring new products and innovation to market, expand our ecosystem and drive productivity across our business. Our first half performance is another proof point of this progress. We are a more focused business that has delivered sustained revenue growth and strong cash generation – a business well positioned for the future
.
Retirement-Related Plans
Our pension plans are well funded. Contributions for all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2024, of which $0.2 billion generally relates to legally required contributions to non-U.S. defined benefit and multi-employer plans. The expected decrease of $0.3 billion in total contributions for 2024 is primarily driven by ongoing dynamics of our retirement-related plans, including the change in U.S. retirement-related benefits described in note 18, "Retirement-Related Benefits." We expect 2024 pre-tax retirement-related plan cost to be approximately $1.5 billion, an increase of approximately $0.3 billion compared to 2023. Within total retirement-related plan cost, operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $1.1 billion, a decrease of approximately $0.1 billion compared to 2023. Non-operating retirement-related plan cost is expected to be approximately $0.4 billion, an increase of approximately $0.5 billion compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher recognized actuarial losses; partially offset by lower interest
cost.
Currency Rate Fluctuations
Changes in the relative values of non-U.S. currencies to the USD affect our financial results and financial position. At June 30, 2024, currency changes resulted in assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies being translated into fewer dollars than at year-end 2023. We use financial hedging instruments to limit specific currency risks related to foreign currency-based transactions.
Movements in currency, and the fact that we do not hedge 100 percent of our currency exposures, will result in a currency impact to our revenues, profit and cash flows throughout 2024. We execute a hedging program which defers, versus eliminates, the volatility of currency impacts on our financial results. During periods of sustained movements in currency, the marketplace and competition adjust to the changing rates over time.
We translate revenue, cost and expense in our non-U.S. operations at current exchange rates in the reported period. References to “adjusted for currency” or “constant currency” reflect adjustments based upon a simple mathematical formula. However, this constant currency methodology that we utilize to disclose this information does not incorporate any operational actions that management could take to mitigate fluctuating currency rates.
Based on the currency rate movements in the second quarter of 2024, revenue from continuing operations increased 1.9 percent as reported and 4 percent at constant currency compared to the prior year. In the first six months of 2024, revenue from continuing operations increased 1.7 percent as reported and 3 percent at constant currency, compared to the same period in 2023. In the second quarter of 2024, currency translation and hedging negatively impacted year-to-year pre-tax income growth and operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth each by approximately $100 million. In the first six months of 2024, currency translation and hedging negatively impacted year-to-year pre-tax income growth and operating (non-GAAP) pre-tax income growth by approximately $300 million and $250 million, respectively. From a segment perspective, in the second quarter of 2024, currency translation and hedging negatively impacted our Infrastructure segment profit margin year-to-year growth by approximately one point. In the first six months of 2024, currency translation and hedging impacted our Infrastructure segment profit margin year-to-year growth by approximately one point, and Software and Consulting by about half of a point each.We view these amounts as a theoretical maximum impact to our as-reported financial results. Hedging and certain underlying foreign currency transaction gains and losses are allocated to our segment results. Considering the operational responses mentioned above, movements of exchange rates, and the nature and timing of hedging instruments, it is difficult to predict future currency impacts on any particular period.
For non-U.S. subsidiaries and branches that operate in U.S. dollars or whose economic environment is highly inflationary, translation adjustments are reflected in results of operations. Generally, we manage currency risk in these entities by linking prices and contracts to
U.S. dollars.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
In our 2023 Annual Report, on pages 30 to 32, there is a discussion of our liquidity including two tables that present three years of data. The table presented on page 30 includes net cash from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities, and the size of our global credit facilities for each of the past three years. For the six months ended, or at, as applicable, June 30, 2024, those amounts are $6.2 billion of net cash from operating activities, $16.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term marketable securities and $10.0 billion in global credit facilities, respectively. While we have no current plans to draw on these credit facilities, they are available as back-up liquidity. On June 17, 2024, the company amended its $2.5 billion Three-Year Credit Agreement and $7.5 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreements) to extend the maturity dates to June 20, 2027 and June 22, 2029, respectively
.
Refer to note 12, “Borrowings,” for additional details on these credit facilities.
The major rating agencies' ratings on our debt securities at June 30, 2024 appear in the following table and remain unchanged from March 31, 2024.
We have financial flexibility, supported by our strong liquidity position and cash flows, to operate at a single A credit rating. At June 30, 2024, our debt level was flat from December 31, 2023 driven by maturities and currency impacts; partially offset by proceeds from issuances.
We do not have “ratings trigger” provisions in our debt covenants or documentation, which would allow the holders to declare an event of default and seek to accelerate payments thereunder in the event of a change in credit rating. Our debt covenants are well within the required levels. Our contractual agreements governing derivative instruments contain standard market clauses which can trigger the termination of the agreement if our credit rating were to fall below investment grade. At June 30, 2024, the fair value of those instruments that were in a liability position was $624 million, before any applicable netting, and this position is subject to fluctuations in fair value period to period based on the level of our outstanding instruments and market conditions. We have no other contractual arrangements that, in the event of a change in credit rating, would result in a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity.
We prepare our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in accordance with applicable accounting standards for cash flow presentation on page
7
of this Form 10-Q and highlight causes and events underlying sources and uses of cash in that format on page
73
. For the purpose of running its business, IBM manages, monitors and analyzes cash flows in a different manner.
Management uses
free cash flow as a measure to evaluate its operating results, plan shareholder return levels, strategic investments and assess its ability and need to incur and service debt. The entire free cash flow amount is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures. We define free cash flow as net cash from operating activities less the change in Financing receivables and net capital expenditures, including the investment in software and other asset sales. A key objective of the Financing business is to generate strong returns on equity, and our Financing receivables are the basis for that growth. Accordingly, management considers Financing receivables as a profit-generating investment, not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency. Therefore, management includes presentations of both free cash flow and net cash from operating activities that exclude the effect of Financing receivables.

Management Discussion – (continued)
The following is
management’s view of cash flows for the first six months of 2024 and 2023 prepared in a manner consistent with the description above.
In the first six months of 2024, we generated $4.5 billion in free cash flow, an increase of $1.1 billion versus the prior-year period. The increase was primarily driven by performance-related improvements within net income and $0.2 billion from timing of capital expenditures.
Events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed previously and in our 2023 Annual Report include significant changes in operating results, material changes in geographic sources of cash, unexpected adverse impacts from litigation, future pension funding requirements, periods of severe downturn in the capital markets or the timing of tax payments. Whether any litigation has such an adverse impact will depend on a number of variables, which are more completely described in note 14, “Contingencies,” in this Form 10-Q. With respect to pension funding, we expect to make legally mandated pension plan contributions to certain non-U.S. defined benefit plans of approximately $200 million in 2024. Contributions related to all retirement-related plans are expected to be approximately $1.5 billion in 2024. Refer to "Retirement-Related Plans" for additional information. Financial market performance could increase the legally mandated minimum contributions in certain non-U.S. countries that require more frequent remeasurement of the funded status. We are not quantifying any further impact from pension funding because it is not possible to predict future movements in the capital markets or changes in pension plan funding regulations. In 2024, we are not legally required to make any contributions to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans.
Our cash flows are sufficient to fund our current operations and obligations, including investing and financing activities such as dividends and debt service. When additional requirements arise, we have several liquidity options available. These options may include the ability to borrow additional funds at reasonable interest rates and utilizing our committed global credit facilities. Our overall shareholder payout remains at a comfortable level and we remain fully committed to our
long-standing
dividend policy.

inancing
Financing is a reportable segment that facilitates IBM clients’ acquisition of hardware, software and services by providing financing solutions, while generating solid returns on equity.
Results of Operations
(1)
Prior-year amounts recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes.
For the three months ended June 30, 2024, financing revenue decreased 8.3 percent as reported (6.6 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, financing revenue decreased 4.9 percent as reported (4.0 percent adjusted for currency) compared to the prior-year period. These declines were primarily driven by a reduction in used equipment sales.
Financing segment profit increased 19.3 percent to $77 million in the second quarter of 2024, compared to the prior-year period and the segment profit margin of 45.3 percent increased 10.5 points year to year. The increase in segment profit was primarily driven by lower unallocated credit loss reserve requirements. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, Financing segment profit increased 2.4 percent to $168 million compared to the prior-year period and the segment profit margin of 46.5 percent increased 3.3 points year to year. The increase in segment profit was primarily driven by lower unallocated reserve requirements in the current year partially offset by settlements on non-accrual assets in the prior year.

Management Discussion – (continued)
We continue to apply our rigorous credit policies. Approximately 75 percent of the total external portfolio was with investment grade clients, an increase of 3 points as compared to December 31, 2023. This investment grade percentage is based on the credit ratings of the companies in the portfolio and reflects certain mitigation actions taken to reduce the risk to IBM.
For additional information relating to the company's credit quality and mitigation actions, including sales of receivables, refer to note 9, “Financing Receivables.”
Return on Equity Calculation
(1)
Prior-year amounts recast to reflect January 2024 segment changes.

(3)
Average of the ending equity for Financing for the last two quarters and three quarters, for the three months ended June 30 and for the six months ended June 30, respectively.
Return on equity was 21.4 percent compared to 17.9 percent for the three months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven by an increase in net income. Return on equity was 22.5 percent compared to 21.4 percent for the six months ended June 30, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The increase was primarily driven by a lower average equity balance and an increase in net income.
Residual Value
