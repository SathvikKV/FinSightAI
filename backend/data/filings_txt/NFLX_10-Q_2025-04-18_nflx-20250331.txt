Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements of Netflix, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S.”) and are consistent in all material respects with those applied in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on January 27, 2025.
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the amortization of content assets and the recognition and measurement of income tax assets and liabilities.  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.  On a regular basis, the Company evaluates the assumptions, judgments and estimates.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The interim financial information is unaudited, but reflects all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein.  The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year.
There have been no material changes in the Company’s significant accounting policies as compared to the significant accounting policies described in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.
Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted
In December 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2023-09,
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
, which requires public entities, on an annual basis, to provide disclosure of specific categories in the rate reconciliation table, as well as disclosure of income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction.  ASU 2023-09 is effective for the Company for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2025.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2023-09.
In November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03,
Income Statement-Reporting Comprehensive Income-Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses
, requiring public entities to disclose additional information about specific expense categories in the notes to the financial statements on an interim and annual basis.  ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2024-03.

Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of outstanding shares of common stock and, when dilutive, potential outstanding shares of common stock during the period.  Potential shares of common stock are calculated using the treasury-stock method and consist of incremental shares issuable upon the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of time-based and performance-based restricted stock units.
The computation of earnings per share is as follows:
The following table summarizes the potential shares of common stock excluded from the diluted calculation as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-term Investments
The Company classifies short-term investments, which consist of marketable securities with original maturities in excess of 90 days as available-for-sale (“AFS”).  The Company does not buy and hold securities principally for the purpose of selling them in the near future.  The Company’s policy is focused on the preservation of capital, liquidity and return.  From time to time, the Company may sell certain securities but the objectives are generally not to generate profits on short-term differences in price.
The following tables summarize the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024:
(1) The majority of the Company's time deposits are international deposits, which mature within one year.
(2) The Company's government securities mature within one year.
Other current assets and non-current assets primarily consist of restricted cash for deposits related to self-insurance.  The fair value of available-for-sale securities, cash equivalents and short-term investments included in the Level 2 category is based on observable inputs, such as quoted prices for similar assets at the measurement date; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable, either directly or indirectly.

million of issuance costs and discounts.  Each of the Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company.  Interest is payable semi-annually at fixed rates.
A portion of the outstanding Notes is denominated in foreign currency (comprised of €
5,170
million) and is remeasured into U.S. dollars at each balance sheet date (with remeasurement loss, net of hedging impacts, totaling $
29
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025).  See Note 7

Revolving Credit Facility
On April 12, 2024, the Company entered into a
five-year
, $
3
billion unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on April 12, 2029 (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), to replace its previous $
1
billion unsecured revolving credit facility.  As of March 31, 2025,
no
amounts have been borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement.
The borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, of either (i) a floating rate per annum equal to a base rate (the “Alternate Base Rate”) plus an applicable margin or (ii) a per annum rate equal to an adjusted term SOFR rate (the “Adjusted Term SOFR Rate”) plus an applicable margin.  The applicable margin for Alternate Base Rate loans will range from
0.00
% to
0.25
%, and the applicable margin for Adjusted Term SOFR Rate loans will range from
0.75
% to
1.25
%, each based on the Company’s credit ratings.
The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and negative covenants (and customary baskets and exceptions with respect thereto) for a credit facility of this size and type and requires the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of
3.0
to 1.0 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.  As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants and ratios.

Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
The Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
Notional Amount of Derivative Contracts
The net notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments were as follows:
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, approximately $
1.1
billion and $
1.0
billion, respectively, of the Company’s euro–denominated Senior Notes were designated as hedges of the foreign exchange risk of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries.
As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount of the Company's euro-denominated Senior Notes (included in "Long-term debt" on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets), which were designated as the hedged items in fair value hedges, was approximately $
3.7
billion and $
3.6
billion, respectively.

Table of Contents
The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.  These instruments are valued using industry standard valuation models that use observable inputs such as interest rate yield curves, and forward and spot prices for currencies.
As of March 31, 2025, the pre-tax net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges included in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets expected to be recognized in earnings within the next 12 months is $
186
million.
Master Netting Agreements
In order to mitigate counterparty credit risk, the Company enters into master netting agreements with its counterparties for its foreign currency exchange contracts which permit the parties to settle amounts on a net basis under certain conditions.  The Company has elected to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis on its Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Company also enters into collateral security arrangements with its counterparties that require the parties to post cash collateral when certain contractual thresholds are met.  Cash collateral received is presented in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” representing the Company’s obligation to return counterparty cash collateral.  Cash collateral posted is presented in “Other current assets,” representing the Company’s right to reclaim the cash collateral.  The Company does not offset the fair value of its derivative instruments against the fair value of cash collateral posted or received.
The potential offsetting effect to the Company’s derivative assets and liabilities under its master netting agreements and collateral security agreements were as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies
Content
As of March 31, 2025, the Company had $
21.8
billion of obligations comprised of $
4.1
billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $
1.7
billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $
16.0
billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.
As of December 31, 2024, the Company had $
23.2
billion of obligations comprised of $
4.4
billion included in "Current content liabilities" and $
1.8
billion of "Non-current content liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $
17.0
billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not yet meet the criteria for recognition.
The expected timing of payments for these content obligations is as follows:
Content obligations include amounts related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content.  Obligations that are in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated to the U.S. dollar at period end rates.  An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements as well as other production related commitments.  An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time the Company enters into an agreement to obtain future titles.  Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date.  Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of such license agreements.  The Company does not include any estimated obligation for these future titles beyond the known minimum amount.  However, the unknown obligations are expected to be significant.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, in the normal course of its operations, the Company is subject to litigation matters and claims, including claims relating to employee relations, business practices and patent infringement.  Litigation can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations.
17
Table of Contents
Moreover, the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and the Company's view of these matters may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.  The Company expenses legal fees as incurred.  The Company records a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  An unfavorable outcome to any legal matter, if material, could have an adverse effect on the Company's operations or its financial position, liquidity or results of operations.
The Company is involved in litigation matters not listed herein but does not consider the matters to be material either individually or in the aggregate at this time.  The Company's view of the matters not listed may change in the future as the litigation and events related thereto unfold.
Non-Income Taxes
The Company is routinely under audit by various tax authorities with regard to non-income tax matters.  The subject matter of non-income tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to our revenue in certain jurisdictions.  We accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable.
Similar to other U.S. companies doing business in Brazil, the Company is involved in a number of matters with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments.  Although the Company believes it has meritorious defenses to these matters, there is inherent complexity and uncertainty with respect to these matters, and the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations.  The current potential exposure with respect to the various issues with Brazilian tax authorities regarding non-income tax assessments is estimated to be approximately $
500
million, which is expected to increase over time.
Guarantees— Indemnification Obligations
In the ordinary course of business, the Company has entered into contractual arrangements under which it has agreed to provide indemnification of varying scope and terms to business partners and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company’s breach of such agreements and out of intellectual property infringement claims made by third parties.  In these circumstances, payment may be conditional on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract.
The Company's obligations under these agreements may be limited in terms of time or amount, and in some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments.  In addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and certain of its officers that will require it, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers.  The terms of such obligations vary.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under these or similar agreements due to the conditional nature of the Company’s obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.
No
amount has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to these indemnification obligations.

Stock Repurchases
In September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $
10
billion of the Company’s common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $
15
billion, also with no expiration date.  Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate.  The Company is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company’s stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.  The Company may discontinue any repurchases of its common stock at any time without prior notice.  During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased
3,713,828
shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $
3.5
billion.  As of March 31, 2025, $

Overview
We are one of the world’s leading entertainment services offering TV series, films and games across a wide variety of genres and languages.  Members can play, pause and resume watching as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, and can change their plans at any time.
Our core strategy is to grow our business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target.  We strive to continuously improve our members' experience by offering compelling content that delights them and attracts new members.  We aim to offer a range of pricing plans, including our ad-supported subscription plan, to meet a variety of consumer needs.  We seek to drive conversation around our content to further enhance member joy, and we are continuously enhancing our user interface to help our members more easily choose content that they will find enjoyable.
Results of Operations
The following represents our consolidated performance highlights
(1)
:
(1) We have discontinued the quarterly reporting of membership numbers, focusing instead on revenue and operating margin as the primary financial metrics that we believe best represent our business performance.  Therefore, effective in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, we are no longer reporting streaming membership metrics, including paid net membership additions (losses), paid memberships at end of period, average paying memberships or average monthly revenue per paying membership.
(2) See the
“Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information”
section below for additional details on our use of constant currency revenue.
Operating margin for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased approximately four percentage points as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to revenues growing at a faster rate as compared to the growth in cost of revenues, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses.
Net income for the three months ended March 31, 2025
increased $558 million as compared to the prior comparative period, primarily due to a $714 million increase in operating income, driven by a $1,172 million increase in revenues and partially offset by a $286 million increase in cost of revenues primarily due to the increase in content amortization. The impact of higher operating income was partially offset by a $130 million decrease in foreign exchange gains and losses and a $41 million increase in the provision for income taxes.

Table of Contents
Revenues
We primarily derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.  We offer a variety of streaming membership plans, the price of which varies by country and the features of the plan.  As of March 31, 2025, pricing on our plans ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $1 to $31 per month, and pricing on our extra member sub accounts ranged from the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2 to $9 per month.  We expect that from time to time the prices of our membership plans in each country may change and we may test other plan and price variations.
We also earn revenues from advertisements presented on our streaming service, consumer products, live experiences and various other sources.  Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and March 31, 2024.
Revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased 13% as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily due to the growth in memberships and higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates, net of hedging.
The following table summarizes revenue by region for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.  Hedging gains (losses) of $165 million and $(11) million are included in “Revenues” for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.  See Note 7
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities
to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the Company’s derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Non-GAAP Constant Currency Information
We believe the non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency revenue is useful in analyzing period-to-period comparisons in revenues absent foreign currency fluctuations.  However, this non-GAAP financial measure should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to other financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.
In order to exclude the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations on revenue, we calculate current period revenue assuming foreign exchange rates had remained constant with foreign exchange rates from each of the corresponding months of the prior-year period and exclude the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues.  Constant currency percentage change in revenues is calculated as the percentage change between current period constant currency revenue and the prior comparative period revenue.  The impact of hedging gains or losses is excluded from both the current and prior periods.
The table below summarizes constant currency revenues by region for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and the constant currency percentage change in revenues by region for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024:

Table of Contents
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues primarily consists of the amortization of content assets.  Other costs of revenues include expenses associated with the acquisition, licensing and production of content, streaming delivery costs, and other operating costs.
Expenses related to the acquisition, licensing and production of content not included in content amortization may include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other personnel-related expenses, costs associated with obtaining rights to music included in our content, overall deals with talent, miscellaneous production-related costs and participations and residuals.  Streaming delivery costs are primarily related to our global content delivery network (“Open Connect”).  We have built our own Open Connect network to help us efficiently stream a high volume of content to our members over the internet. Delivery expenses, therefore, include equipment costs related to Open Connect, payroll and related personnel expenses and all third-party costs, such as cloud computing costs, associated with delivering content over the internet.  Other operating costs include customer service and payment processing fees, including those we pay to our integrated payment partners, as well as other costs directly incurred in making our content available to members.
The increase in cost of revenues was primarily due to a $152 million increase in content amortization relating to our existing and new content.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses for promotional activities such as digital and television advertising, and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners.  Our marketing partners include consumer electronics manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors, mobile operators, and internet service providers.  Our advertising sales partners include advertising technology providers and advertising agencies.  Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support advertising sales and marketing activities.
The increase in sales and marketing expenses was primarily driven by a $33 million increase in personnel-related costs due to the growth in advertising sales headcount, coupled with a $23 million increase in expenses incurred in connection with our advertising offering, including increased payments to advertising sales partners and other advertising distribution expenses.  The increase in expenses related to personnel and our advertising offering was partially offset by an $18 million decrease in other marketing expenses.
25
Table of Contents
Technology and Development
Technology and development expenses consist primarily of payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for technology personnel responsible for making improvements to our service offerings, including testing, maintaining and modifying our user interface, our recommendations and infrastructure.  Technology and development expenses also include costs associated with general use computer hardware and software.
The increase in technology and development expenses was primarily due to a $116 million increase in personnel-related costs.
General and Administrative
General and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for corporate personnel.  General and administrative expenses also include professional fees and other general corporate expenses.
The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a $25 million increase in third-party expenses.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists primarily of the interest associated with our outstanding debt obligations, including the amortization of debt issuance costs.  See Note 6
Debt
in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on our debt obligations.
Interest expense primarily consists of interest on our Notes of $184 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025.  The increase in interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2024 was due to the increase in debt.
Interest and Other Income (Expense)
Interest and other income (expense) consists primarily of foreign exchange gains and losses on foreign currency denominated balances, gains and losses on certain derivative instruments, and interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.
26
Table of Contents
Interest and other income (expense) decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to foreign exchange losses of $36 million, net of the impacts of derivatives and hedging, compared to gains of $94 million for the corresponding period in 2024.  In the three months ended March 31, 2025, the foreign exchange losses were primarily driven by the non-cash loss of $29 million from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million Senior Notes, net of hedging impacts, coupled with the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.  In the three months ended March 31, 2024, the foreign exchange gains were primarily driven by the non-cash gains from the remeasurement of our €5,170 million Senior Notes of $131 million, partially offset by the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions in currencies other than the functional currencies.
Provision for Income Taxes
The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended March 31, 2025, as compared to the same period in 2024, was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits on stock-based compensation.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments decreased $1,211 million in the three months ended March 31, 2025 primarily due to the repurchase of stock and repayment of debt, partially offset by cash provided by operations and proceeds from issuance of common stock.
Debt, net of debt issuance costs and discounts, decreased $566 million primarily due to the repayment upon maturity of the $800 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes, partially offset by the remeasurement of our euro-denominated notes in the three months ended March 31, 2025.  The amount of principal and interest on our outstanding notes due in the next twelve months is $1,697 million. As of March 31, 2025, no amounts had been borrowed under the $3 billion Revolving Credit Agreement.  See Note 6
Debt
in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements.
We anticipate that we may periodically raise additional debt capital.  Our ability to obtain this or any additional financing that we may choose or need, including for the refinancing of upcoming maturities or potential strategic acquisitions and investments, will depend on, among other things, our development efforts, business plans, operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing.  We may not be able to obtain such financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.  If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to the rights of our common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.
In September 2023, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $10 billion of our common stock, with no expiration date, and in December 2024, the Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization by an additional $15 billion, also with no expiration date.  Stock repurchases may be effected through open market repurchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act, including through the use of trading plans intended to qualify under Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, block purchases, or other similar purchase techniques and in such amounts as management deems appropriate.  We are not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including our stock price, general economic, business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.  We may discontinue any repurchases of our common stock at any time without prior notice.  During the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company repurchased 3,713,828 shares of common stock for an aggregate amount of $3.5 billion.  As of March 31, 2025, $13.6 billion remains available for repurchases.
Our primary uses of cash include the acquisition, licensing and production of content, marketing programs, streaming delivery, and personnel-related costs.  Cash payment terms for non-original content have historically been in line with the amortization period.  Investments in original content, and in particular content that we produce and own, require more cash upfront relative to licensed content.  For example,

production costs are paid as the content is created, well in advance of when the content is available on the service and amortized.  We expect to continue to significantly invest in global content, particularly in original content, which will impact our liquidity.  Our other uses of cash include strategic acquisitions and investments, as well as share repurchases.  We currently anticipate that cash flows from operations, available funds and access to financing sources, including our revolving credit facility, will continue to be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the next twelve months and beyond.
Our material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our content, debt and lease obligations. As of March 31, 2025, the expected timing of those payments are as follows:
(1)
As of March 31, 2025, content obligations were comprised of $4.1 billion included in “Current content liabilities” and $1.7 billion of “Non-current content liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and $16.0 billion of obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not then meet the criteria for recognition.
The material cash requirements above do not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years.  However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $1 billion to $4 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months.  The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ.  Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.
(2)
Debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments.  See Note 6
Debt
to the consolidated financial statements for further details.
(3)
Operating lease obligations are comprised of operating lease liabilities included in "Accrued expenses and other liabilities" and "Other non-current liabilities" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, inclusive of imputed interest.  Operating lease obligations also include additional obligations that are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as they did not meet the criteria for recognition.  See Note 5
Balance Sheet Components
in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding leases.
In addition to the material cash requirements summarized in the table above, we may be required to pay deposits of approximately $900 million related to certain direct and indirect taxes in the next twelve months, which are in excess of our typical annual obligations.
Cash Flows
The following table summarizes our cash flows:
Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $577 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily driven by a $558 million or 24% increase in net income, an increase in adjustments for non-cash expenses, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital and a $43 million increase in payments for content assets.
Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $561 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily due to net cash inflows of $614 million from maturities, sales and purchases of investments in the three

months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to no cash flows related to investments in the corresponding period in 2024, partially offset by a $53 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.
Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2025 increased $1,895 million as compared to the corresponding period in 2024, primarily driven by a $1,536 million increase in repurchases of common stock, coupled with a $400 million increase in repayments of debt due to the repayment upon maturity of the $800 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.875% Senior Notes in the three months ended March 31, 2025 as compared to the repayment upon maturity of the $400 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Notes in the three months ended March 31, 2024.

Critical Accounting Estimates
The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the Company’s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and operating results require the Company’s management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  There have been no material changes to the Company’s critical accounting estimates included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are exposed to market risks related to interest rate changes, which affect the market values of our investments and debt, as well as foreign currency fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
At March 31, 2025, our cash equivalents were generally invested in money market funds and time deposits.  Interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate.  Our short-term investments are primarily comprised of investments in government securities.  These securities are classified as available-for-sale and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) within Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of these securities.
As of March 31, 2025, we had $15.1 billion of debt, consisting of fixed rate unsecured debt in fourteen tranches due between 2025 and 2054.  Refer to Note 6
Debt
to the consolidated financial statements for details about all issuances.  The fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest.  The fair value of our debt will also fluctuate based on changes in foreign currency rates, as discussed below.
Foreign Currency Risk
We operate our business globally and transact in multiple currencies.  Currencies denominated in other than the U.S. dollar accounted for 55% of revenue and 29% of operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2025.  We therefore have foreign currency risk related to these currencies, which are primarily the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian real, the Mexican peso, and the Canadian dollar.
Accordingly, volatility in exchange rates and, in particular, a weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our revenue and operating income as expressed in U.S. dollars.  Excluding the impact of hedging gains or losses realized as revenues, our revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2025 would have been approximately $311 million higher had foreign currency exchange rates remained constant with those in the same period of 2024.  See Part I, Item 2, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further information regarding our non-GAAP financial measure of constant currency.
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted U.S. dollar-equivalent revenues from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.  We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency revenue and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Revenues” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the same period the forecasted transaction affects earnings.  If the U.S dollar weakened by 10% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $1,908 million and $1,850 million lower, respectively.  This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying forecasted revenues when recognized in earnings.
We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate fluctuations in forecasted and firmly committed U.S. dollar-equivalent transactions related to the licensing and production of content assets from changes in foreign currency exchange rates.  These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.  We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and initially record the gains or losses on these derivative instruments as a component of AOCI and reclassify the amounts into “Cost of Revenues” to offset the hedged exposures as they affect earnings, which occurs as the underlying hedged content assets are amortized.  If the U.S dollar strengthened by 10% as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the amount recorded in AOCI related to our foreign exchange contracts, before taxes, would have been approximately $201 million and $187 million lower, respectively.  This adverse change in AOCI would be expected to offset a corresponding favorable foreign currency change in the underlying exposures when recognized in earnings.
We use non-derivative instruments to mitigate foreign exchange risk related to our net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries.  These non-derivative instruments may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.  We designate a portion of our foreign currency-denominated Senior Notes in euros as net investment hedges and the gains or losses on these non-derivative instruments are reported as a component of AOCI and remain in AOCI until the hedged net investment is sold or liquidated, at which point the amounts recognized in AOCI are reclassified into earnings.
We have also experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income as a result of gains (losses) on the settlement and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies that are not the functional currency.  We enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on intercompany transactions and monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiaries.  These contracts may reduce, but do not entirely eliminate, the effect of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and we may choose not to hedge certain exposures.  Certain contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and the gains or losses on these derivative instruments are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense)” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  We also designate certain contracts as fair value hedges to mitigate the foreign exchange risk on the remeasurement of our foreign-currency denominated debt.  The gains or losses on these derivative instruments included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recorded in “Interest and other income (expense),” net with the offsetting foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on the hedged items.  If an adverse change in exchange rates of 10% was applied to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
30
Table of Contents
currencies other than the functional currencies as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, income before income taxes would have been approximately $46 million and $38 million lower, respectively, after considering the offsetting impact of the foreign currency exchange contracts and our net investment hedges.

Controls and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Based on that evaluation, our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were effective in providing reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
Our management, including our co-Chief Executive Officers and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2025, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
