Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance and may include statements concerning, among other things, financial results; business plans (including statements regarding new services and products and future expenditures, costs and investments); future liabilities and other obligations; impairments and amortization; estimates of financial impact of certain items, accounting treatment, events or circumstances; competition and seasonality on our businesses and results of operations; and capital allocation, including share repurchases and dividends. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “would,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “could,” “intends,” “target,” “projects,” “forecasts,” “believes,” “estimates,” “anticipates,” “potential,” “continue,” “assumption” or “judgment” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans or intentions. These statements reflect our current views with respect to future events and are based on assumptions as of the date of this report. These statements are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from expectations or results projected or implied by forward-looking statements.
Such differences may result from actions taken by the Company, including restructuring or strategic initiatives (including capital investments, asset acquisitions or dispositions, new or expanded business lines or cessation of certain operations), our execution of our business plans (including the content we create and intellectual properties (IP) we invest in, our pricing decisions, our cost structure and our management and other personnel decisions), our ability to quickly execute on cost rationalization while preserving revenue, the discovery of additional information or other business decisions, as well as from developments beyond the Company’s control, including:
•
the occurrence of subsequent events;
•
deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions or failure of conditions to improve as anticipated;
•
deterioration in or pressures from competitive conditions, including competition to create or acquire content, competition for talent and competition for advertising revenue;
•
consumer preferences and acceptance of our content, offerings, pricing model and price increases, and corresponding subscriber additions and churn, and the market for advertising sales on our direct-to-consumer services and linear networks;
•
health concerns and their impact on our businesses and productions;
•
international, political or military developments;
•
regulatory and legal developments;
•
technological developments;
•
labor markets and activities, including work stoppages;
•
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters; and
•
availability of content.
Such developments may further affect entertainment, travel and leisure businesses generally and may, among other things, affect (or further affect, as applicable):
•
our operations, business plans or profitability, including direct-to-consumer profitability;
•
demand for our products and services;
•
the performance of the Company’s content;
•
our ability to create or obtain desirable content at or under the value we assign the content;
•
the advertising market for programming;
•
income tax expense; and
•
performance of some or all Company businesses either directly or through their impact on those who distribute our products.
Additional factors include those described in our
2023
Annual Report on Form 10-K, including under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Business,” in our subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, including under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in our subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A forward-looking statement is neither a prediction nor a guarantee of future events or circumstances. You should not place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. Unless required by federal securities laws, we assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated, to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the statements are made.

1.
Principles of Consolidation
These Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. We believe that we have included all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim period. Operating results for the six months ended March 30, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending September 28, 2024.
The terms “Company,” “Disney,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company, The Walt Disney Company, as well as the subsidiaries through which its various businesses are actually conducted.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Variable Interest Entities
The Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in our financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together the Asia Theme Parks, see Note 7) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.
Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest
Hulu LLC
In November 2023, NBC Universal (NBCU) exercised its right to require the Company to purchase NBCU’s
33
% interest in Hulu LLC (Hulu), a direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming service provider, at a redemption value based on NBCU’s equity ownership percentage of the greater of Hulu’s equity fair value or a guaranteed floor value of $
27.5
billion. In connection with the redemption, the Company will pay NBCU
50
% of the future tax benefits from the amortization of the purchase of NBCU’s interest in Hulu that will generally arise over a
15
-year period. In December 2023, the Company paid NBCU $
8.6
billion, which reflected the guaranteed floor value less NBCU’s unpaid capital call contributions. If Hulu’s equity fair value is determined to be higher than the guaranteed floor value, the Company is required to pay NBCU its share of the difference between the equity fair value and the guaranteed floor value. Any incremental amount would be recorded as “Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests” and thus reduce “Net income attributable to Disney” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. Estimating the redemption value prior to its final determination requires management to make significant judgments related to assessing the fair value of Hulu.
BAMTech LLC
In November 2022, the Company purchased Major League Baseball’s (MLB)
15

Segment Information
The Company’s operations are reported in three segments: Entertainment, Sports and Experiences, for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the Chief Executive Officer to allocate resources and assess performance.
Segment operating results reflect earnings before corporate and unallocated shared expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, net other income/expense, net interest expense, income taxes and noncontrolling interests. Segment operating income includes equity in the income of investees and excludes amortization of intangible assets and the fair value step-up for film and television costs recognized in connection with the acquisition of TFCF Corporation (TFCF) and Hulu in fiscal 2019 (TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization). Corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of corporate functions, executive management and certain unallocated administrative support functions.
Segment operating results include allocations of certain costs, including information technology, pension, legal and other shared services costs, which are allocated based on metrics designed to correlate with consumption.

The following table presents revenues by segment and primary geographical markets:
Revenues recognized in the current and prior-year periods from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous reporting periods primarily relate to revenues earned on TV/VOD licenses for titles made available to the licensee in previous reporting periods. For the quarter ended March 30, 2024, $
0.3
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied as of December 30, 2023. For the six months ended March 30, 2024, $
0.6
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied as of September 30, 2023. For the quarter ended April 1, 2023, $
0.7
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied as of December 31, 2022. For the six months ended April 1, 2023, $
0.5
billion was recognized related to performance obligations satisfied as of October 1, 2022.
As of March 30, 2024, revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations expected to be recognized in the future is $
14
billion, primarily for IP or advertising time to be made available in the future under existing agreements with merchandise and co-branding licensees and sponsors, television station affiliates, DTC wholesalers, advertisers and sports sublicensees. Of this amount, we expect to recognize approximately $
4
billion in the remainder of fiscal 2024, $
5
billion in fiscal 2025, $
3
billion in fiscal 2026 and $
2
billion thereafter. These amounts include only fixed consideration or minimum guarantees and do not include amounts related to (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less (such as most advertising contracts) or (ii) licenses of IP that are solely based on the sales of the licensee.
When the timing of the Company’s revenue recognition is different from the timing of customer payments, the Company recognizes either a contract asset (customer payment is subsequent to revenue recognition and subject to the Company satisfying additional performance obligations) or deferred revenue (customer payment precedes the Company satisfying the performance obligations). Consideration due under contracts with payment in arrears is recognized as accounts receivable. Deferred revenues are recognized as (or when) the Company performs under the contract. The Company’s contract assets and activity for the current and prior-year periods were not material.

Accounts receivable and deferred revenues from contracts with customers are as follows:
For the quarter and six months ended March 30, 2024, the Company recognized revenue of $
0.9
billion and $
4.4
billion, respectively, that was included in the September 30, 2023 deferred revenue balance. For the quarter and six months ended April 1, 2023, the Company recognized revenue of $
0.9
billion and $
4.3
billion, respectively, that was included in the October 1, 2022 deferred revenue balance. Amounts deferred generally relate to theme park admissions and vacation packages, DTC subscriptions and advances related to merchandise and TV/VOD licenses.
We evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of current and non-current accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods.
The Company has accounts receivable with original maturities greater than one year related to the sale of film and television program rights (TV/VOD licensing) and vacation club properties. These receivables are discounted to present value at contract inception and the related revenues are recognized at the discounted amount. The balance of TV/VOD licensing receivables recorded in other non-current assets was $
0.4
billion at March 30, 2024 and $
0.6
billion at September 30, 2023. The balance of vacation club receivables recorded in other non-current assets was $
0.7
billion at both March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023. The allowance for credit losses for TV/VOD licensing and vacation club receivables and related activity for the periods ended March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were not material.

Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Borrowings
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets to the total of the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
Borrowings
During the six months ended March 30, 2024, the Company’s borrowing activity was as follows:
(1)
The other activity is attributable to market value adjustments for debt with qualifying hedges.
At March 30, 2024, the Company’s bank facilities, which are with a syndicate of lenders and support our commercial paper borrowings, were as follows:
In March 2024, the Company refinanced two bank facilities with committed capacity of  $
5.25
billion and $
3.0
billion, which were scheduled to expire in March 2024 and March 2025, respectively. The new bank facilities are set to expire in February 2025 and March 2029, respectively.
These facilities allow for borrowings at rates based on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and at other variable rates for non-U.S. dollar denominated borrowings, plus a fixed spread that varies with the Company’s debt ratings assigned by Moody’s Investors Service and Standard and Poor’s ranging from 0.655% to 1.225%.
The bank facilities contain only one financial covenant relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On March 30, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The bank facilities specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default. The Company also has the ability to issue up to $
500
million of letters of credit under the facility expiring in March 2027, which if utilized, reduces available borrowings under this facility. As of March 30, 2024, the Company has $
1.6
billion of outstanding letters of credit, of which none were issued under this facility.
Cruise Ship Credit Facilities
The Company has credit facilities to finance a significant portion of the contract price of two new cruise ships, which are scheduled to be delivered in fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026. Under the facilities, $
1.1
billion became available beginning in August 2023 and $
1.1

Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs and Advances
The Company classifies its capitalized produced and acquired/licensed content costs as long-term assets and classifies advances for live programming rights made prior to the live event as short-term assets. For purposes of amortization and impairment, the capitalized content costs are classified based on their predominant monetization strategy as follows:
•
Individual - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are directly attributable to the specific film or television title (e.g. theatrical revenues or sales to third-party television programmers)
•
Group - lifetime value is predominantly derived from third-party revenues that are attributable only to a bundle of titles (e.g. subscription revenue for a DTC service or affiliate fees for a cable television network)
Total capitalized produced and licensed content by predominant monetization strategy is as follows:

Income Taxes
Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities
The Company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities with respect to temporary differences in accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes.
The Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities by major category as of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were as follows:
(1)
Balances at March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 include approximately $

billion and $
1.6
billion, respectively, of International Theme Park net operating losses and include approximately $
0.8
billion and $
1.0
billion, respectively, of foreign tax credits in the U.S. The International Theme Park net operating losses are primarily in France and, to a lesser extent, Hong Kong and China. Losses in France and Hong Kong have an indefinite carryforward period and losses in China have a five-year carryforward period. China theme park net operating losses of $
0.1
billion, if not used, expire between fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2028. Foreign tax credits of $
0.8
billion in the U.S. have a ten-year carryforward period and, if not used, expire beginning in fiscal 2028.
(2)

Valuation Allowance
The Company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities with respect to temporary differences in the accounting treatment of items for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes. Where, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some amount of recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is established for the amount that, in management’s judgment, is sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The Company’s valuation allowance decreased by $
0.2
billion, from $
3.2
billion at September 30, 2023 to $
3.0
billion at March 30, 2024.
Unrecognized Tax Benefits
The Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits (before interest and penalties) decreased $
0.1
billion, from $
2.5
billion at September 30, 2023 to $
2.4

McCarthy, and the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel on behalf of certain purchasers of securities of the Company (the “Securities Class Action”). On November 6, 2023, a consolidated complaint was filed in the same action, adding Robert Iger, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, as a defendant. Claims in the Securities Class Action include (i) violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, (ii) violations of Section 20A of the Exchange Act against Iger and McCarthy,

and (iii) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants. Plaintiffs in the Securities Class Action allege purported misstatements and omissions concerning, and a scheme to conceal, accurate costs and subscriber growth of the Disney+ platform. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, plus interest and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on December 21, 2023. Plaintiffs filed their opposition on February 5, 2024, and the Company filed its reply brief on March 5, 2024. The lawsuit is in the early stages and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.
Three shareholder derivative complaints have been filed. The first, in which Hugues Gervat is the plaintiff, was filed on August 4, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The second, in which Stourbridge Investments LLC is the plaintiff, was filed on August 23, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. And the third, in which Audrey McAdams is the Plaintiff, was filed on December 15, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Each named The Walt Disney Company as a nominal defendant and alleged claims on its behalf against the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Iger; its former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Chapek; its former Chief Financial Officer, Christine M. McCarthy; the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel, and ten current and former members of the Disney Board (Susan E. Arnold; Mary T. Barra; Safra A. Catz; Amy L. Chang; Francis A. deSouza; Michael B.G. Froman; Maria Elena Lagomasino; Calvin R. McDonald; Mark G. Parker; and Derica W. Rice). Along with alleged violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, premised on similar allegations as the Securities Class Action, plaintiffs seek to recover under various theories including breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste. On October 24, 2023, the Stourbridge action was voluntarily dismissed and, on November 16, 2023, was refiled in Delaware state court alleging analogous theories of liability based on state law. On October 30, 2023, the Gervat action was stayed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss filed in the Securities Class Action. The Stourbridge action was likewise stayed under an order entered December 12, 2023 and the McAdams action was stayed under an order entered February 20, 2024. The actions seek declarative and injunctive relief, an award of unspecified damages to The Walt Disney Company and other costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against these lawsuits vigorously. The lawsuits are in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.
On November 18, 2022, a private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to YouTube TV (the “Biddle Action”). The plaintiffs in the Biddle Action asserted a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on allegations that Disney uses certain pricing and packaging provisions in its carriage agreements with virtual multichannel video distributors (“vMVPDs”) to increase prices for and reduce output of certain services offered by vMVPDs. On November 30, 2022, a second private antitrust putative class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the Company on behalf of a putative class of certain subscribers to DirecTV Stream (the “Fendelander Action”). The plaintiffs in the Fendelander Action asserted a claim under Section 1 of the Sherman Act based on substantially similar allegations as the Biddle Action. The Company filed motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim in both the Biddle Action and Fendelander Action on January 31, 2023. The plaintiffs in both cases filed their oppositions on April 7, 2023, the Company filed reply briefs on May 12, 2023, and the court heard oral argument on the Company’s motions to dismiss on July 13, 2023. On September 30, 2023, the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company’s motions to dismiss both cases and, on October 13, 2023, the court issued an order consolidating both cases. On October 16, 2023, plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint (the “Consolidated Complaint”). The Consolidated Complaint asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act and certain Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New York, North Carolina, and Tennessee antitrust laws based on substantially similar allegations as the Biddle Action and the Fendelander Action. The Consolidated Complaint seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuits vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint for failure to state a claim on December 1, 2023. The plaintiffs filed their opposition on January 5, 2024, the Company filed its reply brief on February 2, 2024, and the court heard oral argument on the Company’s motion to dismiss on February 15, 2024. A decision on the Company’s motion to dismiss the Consolidated Complaint remains pending. The consolidated lawsuit is in the early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.
On February 20, 2024, a private antitrust lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company (including affiliates ESPN, Inc., ESPN Enterprises, Inc., and Hulu, LLC), Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (collectively, “Defendants”), by fuboTV Inc. and fuboTV Media Inc. (together, “Fubo”). Fubo asserts claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act, Section 7 of the Clayton Act, and New York antitrust law based on the theories that (a) a planned joint venture between ESPN, Inc., Fox Corporation, and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., which will distribute certain of Defendants’ linear networks to consumers (the “Sports Streaming JV”), will harm competition in an alleged market for the licensing of networks that offer live sports content, (b) certain alleged practices by which the Company and Fox Corporation license their networks to vMVPDs as a bundle increase prices and reduce output for services offered by vMVPDs,

and (c) certain alleged pricing provisions in Defendants’ carriage agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV increase prices for services offered by vMVPDs. On April 8, 2024, Fubo filed a motion for a preliminary injunction against Defendants to prevent the formation of the Sports Streaming JV. Defendants may file their opposition to Fubo’s motion for preliminary injunction by July 25, 2024, and Fubo may file a reply by August 1, 2024, with the hearing on Fubo’s motion for preliminary injunction scheduled to begin on August 7, 2024. Fubo further seeks injunctive relief, unspecified money damages and costs and fees. The Company filed a motion to dismiss Fubo’s complaint on April 10, 2024. On April 29, 2024, Fubo filed an amended complaint to add allegations of a purported market for “skinny sports bundles”, which Fubo claims the Sports Streaming JV will monopolize after its launch. The court has stayed the Defendants’ obligation to answer or move to dismiss Fubo’s amended complaint until after resolution of Fubo’s motion for a preliminary injunction. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously. The lawsuit is in its early stages, and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.
The Company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant in various other legal actions involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. Management does not believe that the Company has incurred a probable material loss by reason of any of those actions.
Commitments
In April 2024, the Company acquired an incremental
5
% interest in Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”), a video game and software developer and publisher, in exchange for $
1.0
billion. The Company is committed to acquire an additional
2
% interest for $
0.5
billion in July 2024, which will bring the Company’s total interest in Epic to approximately
8
%.

Fair Value Measurements
Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and is generally classified in one of the following categories:
Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets
Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets
Level 3 - Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable
The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are summarized in the following tables by fair value measurement Level:
28
THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data)
The fair value of Level 2 investments are primarily determined based on an internal valuation model that uses observable inputs such as stock trading price, volatility and risk free rate.
The fair values of Level 2 derivatives are primarily determined by internal discounted cash flow models that use observable inputs such as interest rates, yield curves and foreign currency exchange rates. Counterparty credit risk, which is mitigated by master netting agreements and collateral posting arrangements with certain counterparties, had an impact on derivative fair value estimates that was not material. The Company’s derivative financial instruments are discussed in Note 16.
Level 2 other liabilities are primarily arrangements that are valued based on the fair value of underlying investments, which are generally measured using Level 1 and Level 2 fair value techniques.
Level 2 borrowings, which include commercial paper, U.S. dollar denominated notes and certain foreign currency denominated borrowings, are valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or identical instruments in markets that are not active.
Level 3 borrowings include the Asia Theme Park borrowings, which are valued based on the current borrowing cost and credit risk of the Asia Theme Parks as well as prevailing market interest rates.
The Company’s financial instruments also include cash, cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable. The carrying values of these financial instruments approximate the fair values.
Non-recurring Fair Value Measure
The Company also has assets that may be required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis. These assets are evaluated when certain triggering events occur (including a decrease in estimated future cash flows) that indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Company recorded impairment charges for goodwill as disclosed in Notes 4 and 17. The fair value of these assets were determined using their estimated discounted future cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique (see Note 17 for a discussion of the more significant inputs used in our discounted cash flow analysis).
16.
Derivative Instruments
The Company manages its exposure to various risks relating to its ongoing business operations according to a risk management policy. The primary risks managed with derivative instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk.

(unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data)
The Company’s derivative positions measured at fair value (see Note 15) are summarized in the following tables:
Interest Rate Risk Management
The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. The Company’s objective is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of its borrowings. In accordance with its policy, the Company targets its fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage. The Company primarily uses pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its interest rate risk management activities.
The Company designates pay-floating interest rate swaps as fair value hedges of fixed-rate borrowings effectively converting fixed-rate borrowings to variable-rate borrowings. The total notional amount of the Company’s pay-floating interest rate swaps at both March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $
13.5
billion.

(unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data)
The following table summarizes fair value hedge adjustments to hedged borrowings:
The following amounts are included in “Interest expense, net” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:
The Company may designate pay-fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of interest payments on floating-rate borrowings. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert floating-rate borrowings to fixed-rate borrowings. The unrealized gains or losses from these cash flow hedges are deferred in AOCI and recognized in interest expense as the interest payments occur. The Company did not have pay-fixed interest rate swaps that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments at March 30, 2024 or at September 30, 2023, and gains and losses related to pay-fixed interest rate swaps recognized in earnings for the quarters ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 were not material.
Foreign Exchange Risk Management
The Company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates. The Company’s objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, enabling management to focus on core business operations.
The Company enters into option and forward contracts to protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. In accordance with policy, the Company hedges its forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed four years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. The gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. The principal currencies hedged are the euro, Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound and Chinese yuan. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings into U.S. dollar denominated borrowings.
The Company designates foreign exchange forward and option contracts as cash flow hedges of firmly committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions. As of March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the notional amounts of the Company’s net foreign exchange cash flow hedges were $
9.8
billion and $
8.3
billion, respectively. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of the foreign currency transactions. Net deferred gains recorded in AOCI for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months total $
309
million.
The following table summarizes the effect of foreign exchange cash flow hedges on AOCI:

(unaudited; tabular dollars in millions, except for per share data)
The Company designates cross currency swaps as fair value hedges of foreign currency denominated borrowings. The impact from the change in foreign currency on both the cross currency swap and borrowing is recorded to “Interest expense, net.” The impact from interest rate changes is recorded in AOCI and is amortized over the life of the cross currency swap. As of both March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, the total notional amount of the Company’s designated cross currency swaps was Canadian $
1.3
billion ($
1.0
billion). The related gains or losses recognized in earnings were not material for the quarters ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023.
Foreign exchange risk management contracts with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. The net notional amount of these foreign exchange contracts at both March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 was $
3.1
billion, respectively.
The following table summarizes the net foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and the net foreign exchange gains or losses on the foreign exchange contracts we entered into to mitigate our exposure with respect to foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities by the corresponding line item in which they are recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:
Commodity Price Risk Management
The Company is subject to the volatility of commodities prices and the Company designates certain commodity forward contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. Mark-to-market gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in AOCI and are recognized in earnings when the hedged transactions occur, offsetting changes in the value of commodity purchases. The notional amount of these commodities contracts at March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 and related gains or losses recognized in earnings for the quarters ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 were not material.
Risk Management – Other Derivatives Not Designated as Hedges
The Company enters into certain other risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting. These contracts, which include certain total return swap contracts, are intended to offset economic exposures of the Company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings. The notional amounts of these contracts at March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023 were $
0.5
billion and $
0.4
billion, respectively. The related gains or losses recognized in earnings were not material for the quarters ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023.
Contingent Features and Cash Collateral
The Company has master netting arrangements by counterparty with respect to certain derivative financial instrument contracts. The Company may be required to post collateral in the event that a net liability position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the Company’s credit rating. In addition, these contracts may require a counterparty to post collateral to the Company in the event that a net receivable position with a counterparty exceeds limits defined by contract and that vary with the counterparty’s credit rating. If the Company’s or the counterparty’s credit ratings were to fall below investment grade, such counterparties or the Company would also have the right to terminate our derivative contracts, which could lead to a net payment to or from the Company for the aggregate net value by counterparty of our derivative contracts. The aggregate fair values of derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features in a net liability position by counterparty were $
1.3
billion and $
1.6
billion at March 30, 2024 and September 30, 2023, respectively.

Restructuring and Impairment Charges
Goodwill Impairments
In the second quarter of fiscal 2024, as a result of Star India assets and liabilities being classified as held for sale (see Note 4), they have been removed from the entertainment goodwill reporting units along with a proportional amount of goodwill. As a result, we evaluated the residual goodwill at our entertainment DTC services and linear networks reporting units for impairment. Star sports was a standalone reporting unit which did not have any goodwill.
The evaluation resulted in a $
0.7
billion non-cash charge for impairment of goodwill at our entertainment linear networks reporting unit. Goodwill was not impaired at the entertainment DTC services reporting unit.
The impairment evaluation compares the reporting unit’s carrying value to its fair value, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. These future cash flows are based on internal forecasts, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our reporting units.
In addition, we recorded a $
1.3
billion non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Star India Transaction (see Note 4 for additional information). Both of these charges were recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Other Restructuring
In the prior-year quarter ended April 1, 2023, the Company recognized restructuring charges of $
152
million primarily for severance costs. The six months ended April 1, 2023 included charges of $
221
million primarily for severance costs and costs related to exiting our businesses in Russia. These charges are recorded in “Restructuring and impairment charges” in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Other Disclosure Rules
Improvements to Reportable Segments Disclosures
In November 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance reportable segment disclosures by requiring the disclosure of significant expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker (CODM) and included in the segment’s measure of profit or loss. It also requires an explanation of how the CODM uses the segment’s measure of profit or loss to assess segment performance and allocate resources. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal year 2025 for annual periods and beginning in fiscal year 2026 for interim periods and requires retrospective adoption (with early adoption permitted). The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.
Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures
In December 2023, the FASB issued guidance to enhance income tax disclosures. The new guidance requires an expanded effective tax rate reconciliation, the disclosure of cash taxes paid segregated between U.S. federal, U.S. state and foreign, with further disaggregation by jurisdiction if certain thresholds are met and eliminates certain disclosures related to uncertain tax benefits. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year (with early adoption permitted). The Company is currently assessing the impacts of the new guidance on its financial statement disclosures.
Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures
In March 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules that will require disclosure of:
•
Certain climate-related information including climate-related risks, targets, and goals that are reasonably likely to have a material impact, as applicable, on a company’s strategy, business, results of operations or financial condition;
•
Certain greenhouse gas emissions, if material; and
•
Certain financial information regarding the effects of severe weather events and other natural conditions, within the notes to the financial statements
The new rules are applicable to annual reporting periods and will be phased in beginning with the Company’s 2026 fiscal year. In April 2024, given pending legal challenges, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order to voluntarily stay the new rules. The Company is evaluating the impacts of the new rules on its financial statement disclosures.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS
CURRENT QUARTER RESULTS COMPARED TO PRIOR-YEAR QUARTER
Revenues for the quarter increased 1%, or $0.3 billion, to $22.1 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased to a loss of $20 million in the current quarter compared to income of $1.3 billion in the prior-year quarter; and diluted earnings per share (EPS) attributable to Disney decreased to a loss of $0.01 compared to income of $0.69 in the prior-year quarter. The EPS
34
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
decrease was due to goodwill impairments in the current quarter, partially offset by higher operating income at Entertainment and Experiences.
Revenues
Service revenues for the quarter increased 1%, or $0.2 billion, to $19.8 billion resulting from higher DTC subscription revenue and increased revenue at our theme parks and resorts. These increases were partially offset by lower theatrical distribution revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower TV/VOD distribution revenue.
Product revenues for the quarter increased 4%, or $0.1 billion, to $2.3 billion due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.
Costs and expenses
Cost of services for the quarter decreased 4%, or $0.5 billion, to $12.7 billion due to lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, lower distribution costs at Entertainment, partially offset by the impact of inflation and increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts.
Cost of products for the quarter increased 4%, or $0.1 billion, to $1.5 billion due to inflation and higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.
Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased 5%, or $0.2 billion, to $3.8 billion, primarily due to higher marketing costs.
Depreciation and amortization decreased 5%, or $0.1 billion, to $1.2 billion driven by lower TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization.
Restructuring and impairment charges
In the current quarter, the Company recorded charges of $2,052 million due to goodwill impairments related to the Star India Transaction and entertainment linear networks. In the prior-year quarter, the Company recognized charges of $152 million primarily for severance.
Other income, net
Other income, net in the prior-year quarter included a DraftKings gain of $149 million.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net is as follows:
Equity in the Income of Investees
Income from equity investees decreased $32 million, to $141 million from $173 million, due to lower income from A+E Television Networks.
Income Taxes
The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to an unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairments recognized in the current quarter, which are not tax deductible, partially offset by a benefit from adjustments related to prior years, which were favorable in the current quarter and unfavorable in the prior-year quarter.
35
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Noncontrolling Interests
The increase in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was primarily due to improved results at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, partially offset by the comparison to the accretion of NBCU’s interest in Hulu in the prior-year quarter with no accretion in the current quarter as we had fully accreted to the amount paid in December 2023 (see Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is determined on income after royalties and management fees, financing costs and income taxes, as applicable.
Certain Items Impacting Results in the Quarter
Results for the quarter ended March 30, 2024 were impacted by the following:
•
Restructuring and impairment charges of $2,052 million

•
TFCF and Hulu acquisition amortization of $558 million
•
Restructuring and impairment charges of $152 million
•
Other income of $149 million due to the DraftKings gain
A summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows:
(1)
Tax benefit (expense) amounts are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item.
(2)
EPS is net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable. Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.
CURRENT SIX-MONTH PERIOD RESULTS COMPARED TO PRIOR-YEAR SIX-MONTH PERIOD
Revenues for the current period increased $0.3 billion, to $45.6 billion; net income attributable to Disney decreased $0.7 billion, to $1.9 billion; and EPS decreased to $1.03 from $1.39 in the prior-year period. The EPS decrease was due to goodwill impairments in the current period, partially offset by higher operating income at Entertainment and Experiences.
Revenues
Service revenues for the current period increased $0.1 billion to $40.7 billion, resulting from higher DTC subscription revenue and increased revenue at our theme parks and resorts. These increases were largely offset by lower theatrical distribution revenue and, to a lesser extent, lower TV/VOD distribution revenue.
Product revenues for the current period increased 3%, or $0.2 billion, to $4.9 billion, due to higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.
36
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Costs and expenses
Cost of services for the current period decreased 5%, or $1.4 billion, to $26.6 billion, primarily due to lower programming and production costs and, to a lesser extent, lower distribution costs at Entertainment, partially offset by the impact of inflation and increased volumes at our theme parks and resorts.
Cost of products for the current period increased 4%, or $0.1 billion, to $3.2 billion, due to inflation and higher sales volumes of merchandise, food and beverage at our theme parks and resorts.

Other income, net in the prior-year period included a DraftKings gain of $79 million and a $28 million gain on the sale of a business.
Interest expense, net
Interest expense, net is as follows:
The increase in interest expense was due to higher average rates, partially offset by higher capitalized interest.
The increase in interest income, investment income and other resulted from from higher interest income on cash balances and a favorable comparison of pension and postretirement benefit costs, other than service cost.
Equity in the Income of Investees
Income from equity investees decreased $42 million, to $322 million from $364 million, due to lower income from A+E Television Networks.
Effective Income Tax Rate
The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to an unfavorable impact from the goodwill impairments recognized in the current period, which are not tax deductible, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate on foreign earnings in the current period.
37
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Noncontrolling Interests
The increase in net income from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interests was due to improved results at our Asia Theme Parks, the accretion of Hulu’s noncontrolling interest to the amount paid in December 2023 (see Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements) and improved results at ESPN, partially offset by the impact of the purchase of Major League Baseball’s 15% interest in BAMtech LLC in the prior-year period.

A summary of the impact of these items on EPS is as follows:
(1)
Tax benefit (expense) amounts are determined using the tax rate applicable to the individual item.
(2)
EPS is net of noncontrolling interest share, where applicable. Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.
SEASONALITY
The Company’s businesses are subject to the effects of seasonality. Consequently, the operating results for the six months ended March 30, 2024 for each business segment, and for the Company as a whole, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year.
Entertainment revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns, changes in viewership and subscriber levels, timing and performance of film releases in the theatrical and home entertainment markets, and the timing of and demand for film and television programs. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber trends of multi-channel video programming distributors (i.e. cable, satellite telecommunications and digital over-the-top service providers). Theatrical release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
Sports revenues are subject to seasonal advertising patterns, changes in viewership and subscriber levels, and the availability of and demand for sports programming. In addition, advertising revenues generated from sports programming are impacted by the timing of sports seasons and events, which varies throughout the year or may take place periodically (e.g. biannually, quadrennially).
38
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Experiences revenues fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and leisure activities, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters, the opening of new guest offerings and pricing and promotional offers. Peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during early winter and spring holiday periods. In addition, theme park and resort revenues may be higher during significant celebrations such as theme park or character anniversaries and lower in the periods following such celebrations. Consumer products revenue fluctuates with consumer purchasing behavior, which generally results in higher revenues during the Company’s first fiscal quarter due to the winter holiday season. In addition, licensing revenues fluctuate with the timing and performance of our film and television content.
BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS
The Company evaluates the performance of its operating businesses based on segment revenue and segment operating income.
The following table presents revenues from our operating segments:

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS - Current Quarter Results Compared to Prior-Year Quarter
Entertainment
Revenue and operating results for the Entertainment segment are as follows:
Revenues
The decrease in Entertainment revenues was primarily due to lower theatrical distribution revenue and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in TV/VOD distribution revenue, partially offset by subscription revenue growth.
Operating income
The increase in operating income in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter was due to improved results at Direct-to-Consumer, partially offset by declines at Linear Networks and Content Sales/Licensing and Other.
40
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Linear Networks
Operating results for Linear Networks are as follows:
Revenues - Affiliate fees
The decrease in domestic affiliate revenue was primarily due to a decrease of 12% from fewer subscribers, including the impact of the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks by an affiliate, partially offset by an increase of 7% from higher contractual rates.
Lower international affiliate revenue was primarily attributable to decreases of 11% from fewer subscribers and 4% from lower contractual rates.
Revenues - Advertising
The decline in domestic advertising revenue was due to a decrease of 12% from fewer impressions, partially offset by an increase of 3% from higher rates primarily due to increased political advertising at the owned television stations. The decrease in impressions was due to lower average viewership.
Higher international advertising revenue was attributable to an increase of 10% from higher rates, partially offset by a decrease of 3% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
41
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Operating expenses
The decrease in domestic programming and production costs was due to a lower average cost mix of programming at ABC Network, partially offset by an increase in the average cost of programming at FX Channels.
The decrease in other operating expenses was primarily due to lower technology and distribution costs.
Equity in the Income of Investees
Income from equity investees decreased $19 million, to $140 million from $159 million, due to lower income from A+E Television Networks attributable to decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue.
Operating Income from Linear Networks
Operating income from Linear Networks decreased $207 million, to $752 million from $959 million, due to decreases at our domestic and international businesses.
Supplemental revenue and operating income
The following table provides supplemental revenue and operating income detail for Linear Networks:

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Direct-to-Consumer
Operating results for Direct-to-Consumer are as follows:
Revenues - Subscription fees
Growth in subscription fees in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter reflected increases of 9% from higher rates attributable to increases in retail pricing at Disney+ Core and Hulu, and 6% from more subscribers due to growth at Disney+ Core.
Revenues - Advertising
Higher advertising revenue in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter reflected an increase of 25% from higher impressions, partially offset by a decrease of 17% from lower rates.
Key metrics
In addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of Disney+

Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber - Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Comparison to First Quarter of Fiscal 2024
Domestic Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber decreased from $8.15 to $8.00 due to a higher mix of wholesale subscribers, partially offset by increases in retail pricing.
International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $5.91 to $6.66 due to increases in retail pricing and a lower mix of subscribers to promotional offerings.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Operating expenses
Higher programming and production costs at Hulu in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter were primarily due to higher subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live TV service and more programming provided on the service, partially offset by lower average costs per hour of content available on the service. The increase in Hulu Live TV subscriber-based fees was attributable to rate increases and more subscribers.
Programming and production costs at Disney+ and other in the current quarter were comparable to the prior-year quarter as lower average costs per hour of content available was offset by more content provided on the service.
The decrease in other operating expense was due to lower distribution costs.
Selling, general, administrative and other
Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $151 million, to $1,106 million from $955 million, due to higher marketing costs.
Operating Income (Loss) from Direct-to-Consumer
Operating results from Direct-to-Consumer increased $634 million, to income of $47 million from a loss of $587 million, due to improved results at Disney+.
Content Sales/Licensing and Other
Operating results for Content Sales/Licensing and Other are as follows:
Revenues - TV/VOD distribution
The decrease in TV/VOD distribution revenue was due to lower sales of episodic content.
Revenues - Theatrical distribution
Theatrical distribution revenue was lower as there were no significant titles released in the current quarter compared to
Ant-Man And The Wasp: Quantumania
in the prior-year quarter. The prior-year quarter also included the benefit of the ongoing performance of
Avatar: The Way of Water
, which was released in December 2022.
45
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Operating expenses
The decrease in programming and production costs was due to lower production cost amortization attributable to the decreases in theatrical and TV/VOD distribution revenues, partially offset by higher film cost impairments in the current quarter.
The decrease in distribution costs and cost of goods sold was attributable to lower theatrical distribution costs.
Selling, general, administrative and other
Selling, general, administrative and other costs decreased $168 million, to $382 million from $550 million, driven by lower theatrical marketing costs reflecting the absence of significant releases in the current quarter.
Operating Income (Loss) from Content Sales/Licensing and Other
Operating results from Content Sales/Licensing and Other decreased $101 million, to a loss of $18 million from income of $83 million due to lower theatrical distribution results and higher film cost impairments.
Items Excluded from Segment Operating Income Related to Entertainment
The following table presents supplemental information for items related to the Entertainment segment that are excluded from segment operating income:
(1)
Charges for the current quarter were due to a goodwill impairment related to linear networks. Charges for the prior-year quarter were primarily for severance.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Sports
Operating results for Sports are as follows:
Revenues - Affiliate fees
Lower domestic ESPN affiliate revenue was driven by a decrease of 8% from fewer subscribers, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates.
The decrease in international ESPN affiliate revenue was due to decreases of 47% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact and 7% from fewer subscribers, partially offset by an increase of 46% from higher contractual rates.
Revenues - Advertising
The increase in domestic ESPN advertising revenue was primarily due to increases of 15% from higher rates and 3% from higher average viewership. These increases included the benefits from an additional College Football Playoff (CFP) game due to timing and an additional NFL playoff game in the current quarter. In the current quarter, we aired the CFP championship game, two semi-final games and one host game compared to the CFP championship game and two host games in the prior-year quarter.
47
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Revenues - Subscription fees
Subscription fees increased $37 million, to $417 million from $380 million, due to higher rates.
Revenues - Other
Other revenue decreased $32 million, to $267 million from $299 million, due to the comparison to sub-licensing fees from Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) programming in the prior-year quarter as we did not renew the rights for the current fiscal year, and lower Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view fees primarily attributable to the impact of airing one less event in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter. These decreases were partially offset by higher fees received from the Entertainment segment to program sports on Star+.
Key Metrics
In addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of ESPN+
(1)
, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business:
(1)
See discussion on page 71-72 —DTC Product Descriptions, Key Definitions and Supplemental Information.
Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber - Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Comparison to First Quarter of Fiscal 2024
ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $6.09 to $6.30 due to increases in retail pricing and higher advertising revenue.
Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber - Second Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Comparison to Second Quarter of Fiscal 2023
ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber increased from $5.64 to $6.30 due to increases in retail pricing and higher advertising revenue.
Operating expenses
Domestic ESPN programming and production costs increased in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter due to higher CFP rights costs attributable to the additional game in the current quarter.
International ESPN programming and production costs were comparable to the prior-year quarter due to a favorable foreign exchange impact, largely offset by inflation and higher costs for soccer programming.
The decrease in Star India programming and production costs reflected the comparison to costs for BCCI cricket programming in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by an increase in Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket programming costs due to more matches aired in the current quarter compared to the prior-year quarter.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Experiences
Operating results for the Experiences segment are as follows:
Revenues - Theme park admissions
Theme park admissions revenue growth was due to increases of 12% from higher average per capita ticket revenue and 4% from attendance growth. Attendance growth was due to an increase at our international parks attributable to higher attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort, which benefited from the park being open for more days in the current quarter, Shanghai Disney Resort and, to a lesser extent, Disneyland Paris. Growth in attendance at our domestic parks was due to an increase in attendance at Disneyland Resort.
Revenues - Resorts and vacations
Higher resorts and vacations revenue was due to increases of 5% from higher average ticket prices for cruise line sailings, 2% from higher occupied hotel room nights and 2% from an increase in average daily hotel room rates.
Revenues - Park & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage
Parks & Experiences merchandise, food and beverage revenue growth resulted from increases of 4% from higher volumes and 2% from guest spending growth. Higher volumes were primarily attributable to an increase at our international parks and experiences reflecting growth at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort.
Revenues - Merchandise licensing and retail
Merchandise licensing and retail revenue was comparable to the prior-year quarter as an increase of 5% from licensing was largely offset by decreases of 2% from retail and 2% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact. The increase in licensing revenue was driven by higher sales of products based on Spider-Man and Mickey and Friends, partially offset by a decrease in sales of products based on Star Wars.
Revenues - Parks Licensing and Other
The increase in parks licensing and other revenue was driven by higher sponsorship revenues and a favorable foreign exchange impact.
50
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Key metrics
In addition to revenue, costs and operating income, management uses the following key metrics to analyze trends and evaluate the overall performance of our theme parks and resorts, and we believe these metrics are useful to investors in analyzing the business:
(1)
Per capita guest spending growth rate and per room guest spending growth rate exclude the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates.
(2)
Attendance is used to analyze volume trends at our theme parks and is based on the number of unique daily entries, i.e. a person visiting multiple theme parks in a single day is counted only once. Our attendance count includes complimentary entries but excludes entries by children under the age of three.
(3)
Per capita guest spending is used to analyze guest spending trends and is defined as total revenue from ticket sales and sales of food, beverage and merchandise in our theme parks, divided by total theme park attendance.
(4)
Occupancy is used to analyze the usage of available capacity at hotels and is defined as the number of room nights occupied by guests as a percentage of available hotel room nights.
(5)
Available hotel room nights is defined as the total number of room nights that are available at our hotels and at Disney Vacation Club (DVC) properties located at our theme parks and resorts that are not utilized by DVC members. Available hotel room nights include rooms temporarily taken out of service.
(6)
Per room guest spending is used to analyze guest spending at our hotels and is defined as total revenue from room rentals and sales of food, beverage and merchandise at our hotels, divided by total occupied hotel room nights. In the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, the Company revised its method of allocating revenue on the sales of Disneyland Paris vacation packages between hotel room revenue and admissions revenue. The new method resulted in a decrease in the percentage of revenue allocated to hotel rooms. If we had applied the new method in the prior-year quarter, the impact would have been a decrease of approximately $9 million in the prior-year quarter.
Operating expenses
Higher operating labor was primarily due to inflation. The increase in infrastructure costs was driven by higher costs for new guest offerings and an increase in operations support costs. Cost of goods sold and distribution costs increased due to higher volumes. The increase in other operating expense was attributable to volume growth, higher operations support costs and inflation.

Period
Entertainment
Revenue and operating results for the Entertainment segment are as follows:
Revenues
The decrease in Entertainment revenues was due to lower theatrical distribution revenue and, to a lesser extent, decreases in TV/VOD distribution, advertising and affiliate revenue. These decreases were partially offset by subscription revenue growth.
Operating income
The increase in operating income was due to improved results at Direct-to-Consumer, partially offset by declines at Content Sales/Licensing and Other and Linear Networks.
Linear Networks
Operating results for Linear Networks are as follows:
Revenues - Affiliate fees
53
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
The decrease in domestic affiliate revenue was due to a decline of 11% from fewer subscribers, including the impact of the non-renewal of carriage of certain networks by an affiliate, partially offset by an increase of 6% from higher contractual rates.
Lower international affiliate revenue was attributable to decreases of 10% from fewer subscribers and 2% from lower contractual rates.
Revenues - Advertising
The decline in domestic advertising revenue was due to decreases of 13% from fewer impressions and 5% from lower rates. The decrease in impressions was due to lower average viewership and, to a lesser extent, fewer units delivered.
Higher international advertising revenue was due to an increase of 6% from higher rates, partially offset by a decrease of 3% from an unfavorable foreign exchange impact.
Operating expenses
The decrease in domestic programming and production costs was due to fewer hours of scripted programming in the current period, reflecting the impact of guild strikes. Scripted programming was primarily replaced with lower average cost non-scripted programming as well as ESPN on ABC sports programming, the costs of which are recognized in the Sports segment.
International programming and production costs increased due to inflation.
The decrease in other operating expenses was driven by lower technology and distribution costs.
Equity in the Income of Investees
Income from equity investees decreased $39 million, to $313 million from $352 million, due to lower income from A+E Television Networks attributable to decreases in advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by a gain on the sale of an investment.
Operating Income from Linear Networks
Operating income from Linear Networks decreased $301 million, to $1,988 million from $2,289 million, due to decreases at our domestic and international businesses.

Revenues - Advertising
Higher advertising revenue reflected an increase of 28% from higher impressions, partially offset by a decrease of 18% from lower rates. The increase in impressions was due to growth of the ad-supported Disney+ service, which launched in December 2022, airing more hours of International Cricket Council (ICC) cricket programming compared to the prior-year period and higher impressions at Hulu.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Key metrics
(1)
In the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, the Company revised its method of allocating revenue on the sales of Disneyland Paris vacation packages between hotel room revenue and admissions revenue. The new method resulted in a decrease in the percentage of revenue allocated to hotel rooms. If we had applied the new method in the prior-year period, the impact would have been a decrease of approximately $26 million in the prior-year period.
Operating expenses
The increase in operating labor was attributable to inflation, higher volumes and increased operations support costs, partially offset by cost saving initiatives. The increase in infrastructure costs was driven by higher operations support costs and increased costs for new guest offerings. Cost of goods sold and distribution costs increased due to higher volumes. Other operating expense increased primarily due to inflation, higher operations support costs and volume growth.
Selling, general, administrative and other
Selling, general, administrative and other costs increased $136 million, to $1,888 million from $1,752 million, driven by inflation and increased marketing costs for new guest offerings, partially offset by the comparison to a loss in the prior-year period on the disposal of our ownership interest in Villages Nature.
Depreciation and amortization
Depreciation and amortization decreased $37 million, to $1,257 million from $1,294 million, due to lower depreciation at our domestic parks and experiences.
Operating Income from Experiences
Segment operating income increased from $4.9 billion to $5.4 billion due to growth at our international parks and experiences and, to a lesser extent, at our consumer products business and domestic parks and experiences.

The following table presents supplemental revenue and operating income (loss) detail for the Experiences segment:
CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES
Corporate and unallocated shared expenses increased $112 million for the quarter, from $279 million to $391 million, primarily attributable to higher costs related to our proxy solicitation and annual shareholder meeting, increased compensation costs and, to a lesser extent, other cost inflation. Corporate and unallocated shared expenses for the current six-month period increased $140 million, from $559 million to $699 million, primarily attributable to increased compensation and human resource-related costs, higher costs related to our proxy solicitation and annual shareholder meeting, and other cost inflation.
FINANCIAL CONDITION
The change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:
Operating Activities
Cash provided by operations increased $3.6 billion from $2.3 billion in the prior-year period to $5.9 billion for the current period. The increase was due to lower film and television production spending and the timing of payments for sports rights. The increase also reflected lower collateral payments related to our hedging program, a payment in the prior-year period related to the termination of content licenses in fiscal 2022 and higher operating cash flow at Experiences. The increase in operating cash flow at Experiences was due to higher operating cash receipts attributable to revenue growth, partially offset by higher operating cash payments. These increases were partially offset by payment in the current period of fiscal 2023 federal and California income taxes, which were deferred pursuant to relief provided by the Internal Revenue Service and California State Board of Equalization as a result of 2023 winter storms in California.

Produced and licensed programming costs
The Entertainment and Sports segments incur costs to produce and license film, episodic, sports and other content. Production costs include spend on content internally produced at our studios such as live-action and animated films, episodic series, specials, shorts and theatrical stage plays. Production costs also include original content commissioned from third-party studios. Programming costs include content rights licensed from third parties for use on the Company’s sports and general entertainment networks and DTC streaming services. Programming assets are generally recorded when the programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities.
The Company’s film and television production and programming activity for the six months ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 are as follows:
The Company currently expects its fiscal 2024 spend on produced and licensed content, including sports rights, to be approximately $24 billion compared to fiscal 2023 spend of $27 billion.

Investing Activities
Investing activities consist principally of investments in parks, resorts and other property and acquisition and divestiture activity. The Company’s investing activities for the six months ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 are as follows:
Capital expenditures at the Entertainment segment primarily reflect investments in technology and in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities and television station facilities.
Capital expenditures at the Experiences segment are principally for theme park and resort expansion, new attractions, cruise ships, capital improvements and technology. The increase in the current period compared to the prior-year period was due to higher spend on new attractions and cruise ship fleet expansion.
Capital expenditures at Corporate primarily reflect investments in corporate facilities, technology and equipment.
The Company currently expects its fiscal 2024 capital expenditures to total approximately $6 billion compared to fiscal 2023 capital expenditures of $5 billion. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to higher spending at Experiences, in part due to continued investment in our Disney Cruise Line business.
Financing Activities
Financing activities for the six months ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023 are as follows:
(1)
Activities related to noncontrolling and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the current and prior-year period were due to payments for redeemable noncontrolling interests in Hulu and BAMTech, respectively (see Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements).
See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the Company’s borrowing activities during the six months ended March 30, 2024 and information regarding the Company’s bank facilities. The Company may use cash balances, operating cash flows, commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its unused $12.25 billion bank facilities and incremental term debt issuances to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.
See Note 12 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2024. There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2024.
66
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
The Company’s operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company’s financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing furloughs or reductions in force.
The Company’s borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company’s performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of March 30, 2024, Moody’s Investors Service’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, Standard and Poor’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch’s long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company’s bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On March 30, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company’s bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.
MARKET RISK
The Company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, commodity fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.
Policies and Procedures
In the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies and commodities using a variety of financial instruments.
Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the Company’s portfolio of borrowings. By policy, the Company targets fixed-rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.
Our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. Accordingly, the Company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the U.S. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses. The Company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the purchase or sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, transactions. The Company also uses forward and option contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. The principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Chinese yuan and Canadian dollar. Cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to U.S. dollar denominated borrowings. By policy, the Company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for periods not to exceed four years. The gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures. The economic or political conditions in a country have reduced and in the future could reduce our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in the country or our ability to repatriate revenue from the country.
Our objectives in managing exposure to commodity fluctuations are to use commodity derivatives to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flows arising from commodity price changes. The amounts hedged using commodity swap contracts are based on forecasted levels of consumption of certain commodities, such as fuel oil and gasoline.
Our objectives in managing exposures to market-based fluctuations in certain retirement liabilities are to use total return swap contracts to reduce the volatility of earnings arising from changes in these retirement liabilities. The amounts hedged using total return swap contracts are based on estimated liability balances.
It is the Company’s policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. The Company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.

OTHER MATTERS
Accounting Policies and Estimates
We believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs
We amortize and test for impairment of capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
Production costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period’s revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).
With respect to produced films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is theatrical performance. Revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the theatrical release are generally highly correlated with theatrical performance. Theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the popularity of competing films at the time of release and the level of marketing effort. Upon a film’s release and determination of the theatrical performance, the Company’s estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets, which may include imputed license fees for content that is used on our DTC streaming services, are revised based on historical relationships and an analysis of current market trends.
With respect to capitalized television production costs that are classified as individual, the most sensitive factor affecting estimates of Ultimate Revenues is program ratings of the content on our licensees’ platforms. Program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the program’s ability to generate advertising and subscriber revenues and are correlated with the license fees we can charge for the content in subsequent windows and for subsequent seasons.
Ultimate Revenues are reassessed each reporting period and the impact of any changes on amortization of production cost is accounted for as if the change occurred at the beginning of the current fiscal year. If our estimate of Ultimate Revenues decreases, amortization of costs may be accelerated or result in an impairment. Conversely, if our estimate of Ultimate Revenues increases, cost amortization may be slowed.
Production costs classified as individual are tested for impairment at the individual title level by comparing that title’s unamortized costs to the present value of discounted cash flows directly attributable to the title. To the extent the title’s unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.
Produced content costs that are part of a group and acquired/licensed content costs are amortized based on projected usage, typically resulting in an accelerated or straight-line amortization pattern. The determination of projected usage requires judgment and is reviewed on a regular basis for changes. Adjustments to projected usage are applied prospectively in the period of the change. Historical viewing patterns are the most significant input into determining the projected usage, and significant judgment is required in using historical viewing patterns to derive projected usage. If projected usage changes we may need to accelerate or slow the recognition of amortization expense.
68
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
Cost of content that is predominantly monetized as a group is tested for impairment by comparing the present value of the discounted cash flows of the group to the aggregate unamortized costs of the group. The group is established by identifying the lowest level for which cash flows are independent of the cash flows of other produced and licensed content. If the unamortized costs exceed the present value of discounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess and allocated to individual titles based on the relative carrying value of each title in the group. If there are no plans to continue to use an individual film or television program that is part of a group, the unamortized cost of the individual title is written down to its estimated fair value. Licensed content is included as part of the group within which it is monetized for purposes of impairment testing.
The amortization of multi-year sports rights is based on projections of revenues for each season relative to projections of total revenues over the contract period (estimated relative value). Projected revenues include advertising revenue and an allocation of affiliate revenue. If the annual contractual payments related to each season approximate each season’s estimated relative value, we expense the related contractual payments during the applicable season. If estimated relative values by year were to change significantly, amortization of our sports rights costs may be accelerated or slowed.
Revenue Recognition
The Company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. Refer to Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for our revenue recognition policies.
Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Actuarial Assumptions
The Company’s pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs are calculated using a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement, which we evaluate annually. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K for estimated impacts of changes in these assumptions. Other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover and rate of compensation increase.
The discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension and postretirement medical expense. The guideline for setting this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. The Company’s discount rate was determined by considering yield curves constructed of a large population of high-quality corporate bonds and reflects the matching of the plans’ liability cash flows to the yield curves.
To determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. A lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension and postretirement medical expense.
Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets, Long-Lived Assets and Investments
The Company is required to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and if current events or circumstances require, on an interim basis. The Company performs its annual test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment in its fiscal fourth quarter.
Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are an operating segment or one level below the operating segment. To test goodwill for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows of the reporting unit.
The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount, and to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, an impairment of goodwill is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.
The impairment test for goodwill requires judgment related to the identification of reporting units, the assignment of assets and liabilities including goodwill to reporting units, and the determination of fair value of the reporting units. To determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flows) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. The discounted cash flow analyses are sensitive to our estimated projected future cash flows as well as the discount rates used to calculate their present value. Our future cash flows are based on internal forecasts for each reporting unit, which consider projected inflation and other economic indicators, as well as industry
69
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
growth projections. Discount rates are determined based on the inherent risks of the underlying operations. We believe our estimates are consistent with how a marketplace participant would value our businesses.
As discussed in Note 17 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge at our entertainment linear networks reporting unit of $0.7 billion. The entertainment linear networks reporting unit goodwill after impairment is approximately $6 billion.
After impairment, our entertainment linear networks reporting unit does not have excess fair value over carrying amount, and a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate or a 1% reduction in projected annual cash flows used to determine fair value would each result in an incremental impairment charge of approximately $0.3 billion.
In addition, as discussed in our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of our fiscal 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the fair value of our entertainment DTC services reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by less than 10%. Goodwill of the entertainment DTC services reporting unit is approximately $45 billion.
For our entertainment DTC services reporting unit, a 25 basis point increase in the discount rate used to determine fair value would eliminate the excess fair value over carrying amount, and a 1% reduction in projected annual cash flows would result in a decrease in the excess fair value over carrying amount by approximately $0.9 billion.
Significant judgments and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model used to determine fair value relate to future revenues and certain operating expenses, terminal growth rates and discount rates. Changes to these assumptions, shifts in market trends, or the impact of macroeconomic events could produce test results in the future that differ, and we could be required to record additional impairment charges.
To test other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, the Company first performs a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of each of its indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds its fair value. If it is, a quantitative assessment is required. Alternatively, the Company may bypass the qualitative assessment and perform a quantitative impairment test.
The qualitative assessment requires the consideration of factors such as recent market transactions, macroeconomic conditions and changes in projected future cash flows.
The quantitative assessment compares the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the excess. Fair values of indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values, as appropriate.
The Company tests long-lived assets, including amortizable intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances (triggering events) indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Once a triggering event has occurred, the impairment test employed is based on whether the Company’s intent is to hold the asset for continued use or to hold the asset for sale. The impairment test for assets held for use requires a comparison of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the useful life of the significant assets of an asset group to the carrying amount of the asset group. An asset group is generally established by identifying the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and could include assets used across multiple businesses. If the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment would be measured as the difference between the fair value of the asset group and the carrying amount of the asset group. For assets held for sale, to the extent the carrying amount is greater than the asset’s fair value less costs to sell, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference. Determining whether a long-lived asset is impaired requires various estimates and assumptions, including whether a triggering event has occurred, the identification of asset groups, estimates of future cash flows and the discount rate used to determine fair values.
As discussed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Star India Transaction of $1.3 billion to reflect Star India at its estimated fair value less costs to sell. The fair value and carrying amount of Star India are subject to change depending on developments and results of operations for the duration that Star India is classified as held for sale and we may be required to record additional impairment charges.
The Company has investments in equity securities. For equity securities that do not have a readily determinable fair value, we consider forecasted financial performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. If these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be recorded.
Allowance for Credit Losses
We evaluate our allowance for credit losses and estimate collectability of accounts receivable based on historical bad debt experience, our assessment of the financial condition of individual companies with which we do business, current market
70
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. In times of economic turmoil, including COVID-19, our estimates and judgments with respect to the collectability of our receivables are subject to greater uncertainty than in more stable periods. If our estimate of uncollectible accounts is too low, costs and expenses may increase in future periods, and if it is too high, costs and expenses may decrease in future periods. See Note 3 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.
Contingencies and Litigation
We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and have been developed in consultation with outside counsel as appropriate. From time to time, we are also involved in other contingent matters for which we accrue estimates for a probable and estimable loss. It is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to legal proceedings or our assumptions regarding other contingent matters. See Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.
Income Tax
As a matter of course, the Company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. From time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. Our determinations regarding the recognition of income tax benefits are made in consultation with outside tax and legal counsel, where appropriate, and are based upon the technical merits of our tax positions in consideration of applicable tax statutes and related interpretations and precedents and upon the expected outcome of proceedings (or negotiations) with taxing and legal authorities. The tax benefits ultimately realized by the Company may differ from those recognized in our future financial statements based on a number of factors, including the Company’s decision to settle rather than litigate a matter, relevant legal precedent related to similar matters and the Company’s success in supporting its filing positions with taxing authorities.
New Accounting Pronouncements
See Note 18 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding new accounting pronouncements.
DTC PRODUCT DESCRIPTIONS,  KEY DEFINITIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Product Offerings
In the U.S., Disney+, ESPN+ and Hulu SVOD Only are each offered as a standalone service or together as part of various multi-product offerings. Hulu Live TV + SVOD includes Disney+ and ESPN+. Disney+ is available in more than 150 countries and territories outside the U.S. and Canada. In India and certain other Southeast Asian countries, the service is branded Disney+ Hotstar. In certain Latin American countries, we offer Disney+ as well as Star+, a general entertainment SVOD service, which is available on a standalone basis or together with Disney+ (Combo+). Depending on the market, our services can be purchased on our websites or through third-party platforms/apps or are available via wholesale arrangements.
Paid Subscribers
Paid subscribers reflect subscribers for which we recognized subscription revenue. Subscribers cease to be a paid subscriber as of their effective cancellation date or as a result of a failed payment method. Subscribers to multi-product offerings in the U.S. are counted as a paid subscriber for each service included in the multi-product offering and subscribers to Hulu Live TV + SVOD are counted as one paid subscriber for each of the Hulu Live TV + SVOD, Disney+ and ESPN+ services. In Latin America, if a subscriber has either the standalone Disney+ or Star+ service or subscribes to Combo+, the subscriber is counted as one Disney+ paid subscriber. Subscribers include those who receive an entitlement to a service through wholesale arrangements, including those for which the service is available to each subscriber of an existing content distribution tier. When we aggregate the total number of paid subscribers across our DTC streaming services, we refer to them as paid subscriptions.
International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar)
International Disney+ (excluding Disney+ Hotstar) includes the Disney+ service outside the U.S. and Canada and the Star+ service in Latin America.
Average Monthly Revenue Per Paid Subscriber
Hulu and ESPN+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated based on the average of the monthly average paid subscribers for each month in the period. The monthly average paid subscribers is calculated as the sum of the beginning of the month and end of the month paid subscriber count, divided by two. Disney+ average monthly revenue per paid subscriber is calculated using a daily average of paid subscribers for the period. Revenue includes subscription fees, advertising (excluding
71
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
revenue earned from selling advertising spots to other Company businesses) and premium and feature add-on revenue but excludes Pay-Per-View revenue. Advertising revenue generated by content on one DTC streaming service that is accessed through another DTC streaming service by subscribers to both streaming services is allocated between both streaming services. The average revenue per paid subscriber is net of discounts on offerings that carry more than one service. Revenue is allocated to each service based on the relative retail or wholesale price of each service on a standalone basis. Hulu Live TV + SVOD revenue is allocated to the SVOD services based on the wholesale price of the Hulu SVOD Only, Disney+ and ESPN+ multi-product offering. In general, wholesale arrangements have a lower average monthly revenue per paid subscriber than subscribers that we acquire directly or through third-party platforms.
Supplemental information about paid subscribers:

SUPPLEMENTAL GUARANTOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION
On March 20, 2019 as part of the acquisition of TFCF, The Walt Disney Company (“TWDC”) became the ultimate parent of TWDC Enterprises 18 Corp. (formerly known as The Walt Disney Company) (“Legacy Disney”). Legacy Disney and TWDC are collectively referred to as “Obligor Group”, and individually, as a “Guarantor”. Concurrent with the close of the TFCF acquisition, $16.8 billion of TFCF’s assumed public debt (which then constituted 96% of such debt) was exchanged for senior notes of TWDC (the “exchange notes”) issued pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of March 20, 2019, between TWDC, Legacy Disney, as guarantor, and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the “TWDC Indenture”) and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. On November 26, 2019, $14.0 billion of the outstanding exchange notes were exchanged for new senior notes of TWDC registered under the Securities Act, issued pursuant to the TWDC Indenture and guaranteed by Legacy Disney. In addition, contemporaneously with the closing of the March 20, 2019 exchange offer, TWDC entered into a guarantee of the registered debt securities issued by Legacy Disney under the Indenture dated as of September 24, 2001 between Legacy Disney and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “2001 Trustee”) (as amended by the first supplemental indenture among Legacy Disney, as issuer, TWDC, as guarantor, and the 2001 Trustee, as trustee).
Other subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either TWDC or Legacy Disney (such subsidiaries are referred to as the “non-Guarantors”). The par value and carrying value of total outstanding and guaranteed registered debt securities of the Obligor Group at March 30, 2024 was as follows:
The guarantees by TWDC and Legacy Disney are full and unconditional and cover all payment obligations arising under the guaranteed registered debt securities. The guarantees may be released and discharged upon (i) as a general matter, the indebtedness for borrowed money of the consolidated subsidiaries of TWDC in aggregate constituting no more than 10% of all
72
MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — (continued)
consolidated indebtedness for borrowed money of TWDC and its subsidiaries (subject to certain exclusions), (ii) upon the sale, transfer or disposition of all or substantially all of the equity interests or all or substantially all, or substantially as an entirety, the assets of Legacy Disney to a third party, and (iii) other customary events constituting a discharge of a guarantor’s obligations. In addition, in the case of Legacy Disney’s guarantee of registered debt securities issued by TWDC, Legacy Disney may be released and discharged from its guarantee at any time Legacy Disney is not a borrower, issuer or guarantor under certain material bank facilities or any debt securities.
Operations are conducted almost entirely through the Company’s subsidiaries. Accordingly, the Obligor Group’s cash flow and ability to service its debt, including the public debt, are dependent upon the earnings of the Company’s subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to the Obligor Group, whether by dividends, loans or otherwise. Holders of the guaranteed registered debt securities have a direct claim only against the Obligor Group.
Set forth below is summarized financial information for the Obligor Group on a combined basis after elimination of (i) intercompany transactions and balances between TWDC and Legacy Disney and (ii) equity in the earnings from and investments in any subsidiary that is a non-Guarantor. This summarized financial information has been prepared and presented pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X Rule 13-01, “Financial Disclosures about Guarantors and Issuers of Guaranteed Securities” and is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with GAAP.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings
As disclosed in Note 14 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company is engaged in certain legal matters, and the disclosure set forth in Note 14 relating to certain legal matters is incorporated herein by reference.
ITEM 1A. Risk Factors
For an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the factors discussed in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1A, “Risk Factors” as updated below:
BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS
Regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.
Each of our businesses, including our broadcast networks and television stations, is subject to a variety of U.S. and international regulations, which impact the operations and profitability of our businesses. Some of these regulations include:
•
U.S. Federal Communications Commission regulation of our television and radio networks, our national programming networks and our owned television stations. See our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K under Item 1 — Federal Regulation - Entertainment and Sports.
•
Federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
•
Regulation of the safety and supply chain of consumer products and theme park operations, including regulation regarding the sourcing, importation and the sale of goods.
•
Land planning, use and development regulations applicable to our theme parks operations.
•
Environmental protection regulations.
•
U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, sanction programs, trade restrictions and anti-money laundering laws.
•
Restrictions on the manner in which content is currently licensed and distributed, ownership restrictions or film or television content requirements, investment obligations or quotas.
•
Domestic and international labor laws, tax laws or currency controls.
New laws and regulations, as well as changes in any of these current laws and regulations or regulator activities in any of these areas, or others, may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services in ways that are profitable, and create an increasingly unpredictable regulatory landscape. In addition, ongoing and future developments in international political, trade and security policy may lead to new regulations limiting international trade and investment and disrupting our operations outside the U.S., including our international theme parks and resorts operations in France, mainland China and Hong Kong. For example, in 2022 the U.S. and other countries implemented a series of sanctions against Russia in response to events in Russia and Ukraine; U.S. agencies have enhanced trade restrictions, including new prohibitions on the importation of goods from certain regions and other jurisdictions are considering similar measures; U.S. state governments have become more active in passing legislation targeted at specific sectors and companies and applying existing laws in novel ways to new technologies, including streaming and online commerce; and in many countries/regions around the world (including but not limited to the European Union) regulators are requiring us to broadcast on our linear networks (or display on our DTC streaming services) programming produced in specific countries as well as invest specified amounts of our revenues in local content productions. In Florida, legislative, regulatory and other steps directed at the Company have been taken, which collectively have negatively impacted our ability to execute on our business strategy, and such steps, along with future potential legislative and regulatory actions, could negatively impact our costs and the growth and profitability of our operations in Florida.
Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health and other regional, national, state and local regulations and policies impacted most of our businesses. Government requirements could be reinstated and new government requirements may be imposed to address COVID-19 or future health outbreaks or pandemics.
