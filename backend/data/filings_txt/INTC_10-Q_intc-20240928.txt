Total revenue of $13.3 billion was down $874 million from Q3 2023, as CCG revenue decreased 7%, Altera
®
revenue decreased 44%, and  external Intel Foundry revenue decreased 79%, partially offset by an increase in DCAI revenue of 9%. Our consolidated results of operations were materially impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our net deferred tax assets in Q3 2024.
Key Developments
▪
We continued to advance our previously-announced cost-reduction measures by effectuating the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including reductions in headcount by 16,500 employees, other operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales, with respect to which we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in Q3 2024.
▪
Our consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted in Q3 2024 by the following charges:
▪
$3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recognized in cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;
▪
$2.9 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets; and
▪
$9.9 billion of non-cash charges that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets.
▪
We announced our intention to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. This structure provides clearer separation for external foundry customers and suppliers between Intel Foundry and our Intel Products businesses. It also gives us future flexibility to evaluate independent sources of funding and optimize the capital structure of Intel Foundry and our Intel Products businesses to maximize growth and stockholder value.
▪
We were awarded up to $3.0 billion in direct funding under the CHIPS and Science Act for the Secure Enclave program, which is designed to expand the trusted manufacturing of leading-edge semiconductors for the U.S. government.
▪
We launched our latest family of x86 processors, the Intel
®
Core™ Ultra 200V series processors, which deliver exceptional performance, breakthrough x86 power efficiency, improved graphics performance, no-compromise application compatibility, enhanced security and competitive AI compute capabilities.
▪
We announced our next-generation of AI solutions with the launch of the Intel
®
Xeon
®
6 processor with Performance-cores and the Intel
®
Gaudi
®
3 AI accelerator.

We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2023 Form 10-K.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
We made certain reclassifications within our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements during 2024, and, in certain cases, adjusted prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no impact on previously reported net income (loss), cash flows, or stockholders' equity.
We previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to third party customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions.
Our internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business, with segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results. As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.
We organize our business as follows:
▪
Intel Products:
▪
C
lient Computing Group (CCG)
▪
Data
Center and AI (DCAI)
▪
Network
and Edge (NEX)
▪
Intel Foundry
▪
All other
▪
A
ltera
▪
M
obileye
▪
Other
CCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX, Altera, and Mobileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.
The accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:
Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of revenues from third party customers. The Intel Products operating segments represent a substantial majority of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.
Table of Contents
Intel Foundry
▪
Segment revenue
: consists substantially of intersegment product and services revenue for wafer fabrication, substrates and other related products, and services sold to Intel Products, Altera, and certain other Intel internal businesses. We recognize intersegment revenue based on the completion of performance obligations. Product revenue is recognized upon delivery and transfer of ownership which is generally at the completion of wafer sorting. Backend service revenue is recognized upon the completion of assembly and test milestones, which approximates the recognition of revenue over the service period. Intersegment sales are recorded at prices that are intended to approximate market pricing. Intel Foundry also includes certain third party foundry and assembly and test revenues from external customers that were $
67
million in the three months ended September 28, 2024 and $
171
million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to $
312
million in the three months ended September 30, 2023 and $
661
million in the first nine months of 2023.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external customers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing includes excess capacity charges.
All Other: Altera & Mobileye
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of product revenues from third party customers. Altera revenue is derived from programmable semiconductors, primarily FPGAs, CPLDs, acceleration platforms, software, IP, and related products. Mobileye revenue is derived from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.
▪
Segment expenses:
Altera expenses consist of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, third party manufacturing expenses, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Mobileye expenses consists of third party direct expenses for product manufacturing and related services for the manufacturing of Mobileye products and direct operating expenses.
Our "all other" category also consists of "other", which includes:
▪
results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives; and
▪
historical results of operations from divested businesses.
We allocate operating expenses from our sales and marketing group to the Intel Products operating segments and allocate operating expenses from our finance and administration groups to all of our operating segments, except Mobileye.
We estimate that the substantial majority of our consolidated depreciation expense was incurred by Intel Foundry in the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. Intel Foundry depreciation expense is substantially included in overhead cost pools and then combined with other costs, and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through the manufacturing process and is sold to Intel Products or other customers. As a result, it is impracticable to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each Intel Products operating segment's operating income (loss).
We do not allocate to our operating segments corporate operating expenses that primarily consist of:
▪
restructuring and other charges;
▪
share-based compensation;
▪
certain impairment charges; and
▪
certain acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
We do not allocate to our operating segments non-operating items such as:
▪
gains and losses from equity investments;
▪
interest and other income; and
▪
income taxes.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The measures regularly provided to and used by our CODM under our new operating model continue to evolve; currently, our CODM does not regularly review or receive discrete asset information by segment.
Intersegment eliminations:
Intersegment sales and related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third party customers is eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies, respectively. Thus, certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level. This activity primarily relates to inventory reserves, which are determined and recorded based on our accounting policies for Intel as a whole but are only recorded by the Intel Products operating segments upon transfer of inventory from Intel Foundry. If a reserve is identified which relates to neither Intel Products operating segments nor Intel Foundry, the reserve is recognized as activity within the intersegment eliminations for Intel on a consolidated basis.

Operating segment and consolidated net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:
Table of Contents
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses include certain operating and non-operating costs not allocated to specific operating segments. The nature of these expenses may vary, but primarily consist of restructuring and other charges, share-based compensation, certain impairment charges, and certain acquisition-related costs.

Semiconductor Co-Investment Program
Ireland SCIP
In the second quarter of 2024, we closed a transaction with Apollo Global Management, Inc., involving the sale of
49
% of our interest in an Irish limited liability company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of $
11.0
billion, substantially all of which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a VIE that we consolidate into our consolidated financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase
100
% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator. Once Fab 34 construction is complete, we will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to pay certain penalties to Ireland SCIP.
As of September 28, 2024, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, most
of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
Arizona SCIP
We consolidate the results of an Arizona limited liability company (Arizona SCIP), a VIE, into our consolidated financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from Arizona SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase
100
% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona SCIP at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties.
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona SCIP of $
29.0
billion.
As of September 28, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Arizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The assets held by Arizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were $
9.3
billion as of September 28, 2024 ($
4.8
billion as of December 30, 2023).

Mobileye
In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted
38.5
million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing
5
% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $
42
per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $
1.6
billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $
663
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements. In the third quarter of 2024, the non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our Mobileye reporting unit was attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders based on our proportional ownership (see "Note 10: Goodwill" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements).
IMS Nanofabrication
In 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined
32
% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment — including a
20
% stake to Bain Capital and a
10
% stake to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $
1.4
billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $
958
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.
We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan. The potentially dilutive impact from the assumed issuance of common stock associated with the contractual conversion feature is determined by applying the if-converted method to the assumed exercise of the outstanding conversion feature.
In the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and in the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan, and the assumed issuance of common stock associated with a contractual conversion feature, as applicable, had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share and were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share. During the three months ended September 28, 2024,
160
million anti-dilutive shares were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. In all other periods presented, securities that would have been anti-dilutive were insignificant.
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as
cash provided by operating activities
in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $
1.5
billion during the first nine months of 2024 and 2023. After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.

Inventories
Property, Plant, and Equipment
We invest in and deploy manufacturing assets in response to manufacturing capacity requirements based upon short- and long-term demand forecasts and economic returns relative to capital outlays. We regularly monitor, evaluate, and adjust our manufacturing capacity footprint in response to a number of volatile factors that impact our business, including demand for our products and services and the state of the semiconductor industry as a whole. In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for the third quarter of 2024, we evaluated our current process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services, concluding that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon performing a re-use assessment, we impaired and accelerated depreciation for certain manufacturing assets. In total, we recorded non-cash impairments and accelerated depreciation charges of $
2.1
billion and $
945
million, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024, substantially all of which were recognized in
cost of sales
within our Intel Foundry operating segment.
We also incurred certain other non-cash asset impairment charges of $
442
million as a direct result of the 2024 Restructuring Plan (see "Note 6: Restructuring and Other Charges" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements). These charges were included as a component of "corporate unallocated expenses" within the
restructuring and other
category presented in "Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Coinciding with the analysis described above and due to the reduction in our market capitalization relative to the net book value of our assets, we tested our asset groupings for impairment. As a result of that testing, which evaluated whether the carrying value of our asset group is recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, we concluded that the remaining carrying value of property, plant, and equipment is recoverable as of September 28, 2024.
Other Accrued Liabilities
Other accrued liabilities
include deferred compensation of $
3.2
billion as of September 28, 2024 ($
2.9
billion as of December 30, 2023).
Interest and Other, Net
Interest expense
is net of $
392
million of interest capitalized in the third quarter of 2024 and $
1.1
billion in the first nine months of 2024 ($

1.1
billion in the first nine months of 2023).
Table of Contents
In the third quarter of 2024, the 2024 Restructuring Plan was announced, subsequently approved and committed to by our management team, and initiated to implement cost-reduction measures, including reductions in employee headcount, other operating and non-operating expenditures, and capital expenditures. Restructuring charges are primarily comprised of employee severance and benefit arrangements, non-cash charges related to asset impairments associated with exit activities, as well as charges relating to real estate exits and consolidations. These charges were included as
"corporate unallocated
expenses" within the
restructuring and other
category presented in "Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements. We expect to recognize total charges of approximately $
3.0
billion under the 2024 Restructuring Plan, the substantial majority of which will be cash settled in future periods. The cumulative cost of the 2024 Restructuring Plan as of September 28, 2024 was $
2.8
billion. Any changes to our estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations in future periods. We expect actions pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan to be substantially complete
by
the fourth quarter of 2025, which is subject to change.
Employee severance and benefit arrangements
includes charges of $
2.2
billion in the third quarter of 2024 relating to the 2024 Restructuring Plan. Charges relating to other actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs were $
294
million in the nine months ended September 28, 2024, which we expect will be
substantially complete
by the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect employee severance and benefit-related actions resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan to be
substantially complete
by the fourth quarter of 2025, which is subject to change. Charges accrued as of September 28, 2024 were recorded as current liabilities within
accrued compensation and benefits
on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets
.
Charges in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 primarily related to the 2022 Restructuring Program, which was completed in the first quarter of 2024.
Litigation charges and other
includes a charge of $
780
million in the second quarter of 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. In the third quarter of 2023, we recorded a $
401
million charge for an EC-imposed fine. Refer to "Note 14: Contingencies" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for information about these items. Also, in the third quarter of 2023, we incurred and paid a termination fee of $
353
million in connection with our
inability to timely obtain required regulatory approvals needed to acquire Tower Semiconductor, Ltd. (Tower).
Asset impairment charges
in the third quarter of 2024 primarily includes cash and non-cash charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including $
442
million of non-cash impairments of construction in progress assets associated with our decision to exit and outsource manufacturing capabilities for certain internal test hardware; and $
86
million of non-cash impairments of operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements resulting from real estate consolidations and exits.
Real estate consolidations and exits did not materially change our operating lease liabilities and may result in future cash outlays for facility restoration or the relocation of operations.
These impairments were recorded within
property, plant, and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation,
except for the impairment of operating leased assets of $
72
million which were recorded within
other long-term assets
on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2024.
In addition, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $
2.8
billion and $
3.0
billion in the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, respectively (see "Note 10: Goodwill" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements). Further, in the third quarter of 2024, as a result of a decline in the actual and projected undiscounted cash flows for certain acquired intangible assets, we concluded the assets were not recoverable and recognized a non-cash impairment charge of $
108
million. Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges were included as "corporate unallocated expenses" within the
restructuring and other
category presented in "Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements.
Table of Contents
In the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024, we established a valuation allowance of $
9.9
billion as a discrete non-cash tax expense against our US deferred tax assets. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment in the third quarter of 2024, we determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of September 28, 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during the current quarter. Deferred tax liabilities of $
1.7
billion and $
186
million were included within
other long-term liabilities
on
the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively, and deferred tax assets of $
634
million and $
5.5
billion were included within
other long-term assets
on the Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets as of of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023, respectively.
In the three and nine months ended September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023, our provisions for, or benefit from, income taxes were determined using an actual annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, as we were unable to make a reliable estimate of our annual effective tax rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted annual income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.

Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within
cash and cash equivalents
and
short-term investments
on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets
.
Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of September 28, 2024 and December 30, 2023,
substantially all
time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in
interest and other, net
. The fair value of our hedged investments was $
14.9
billion as of September 28, 2024 ($
17.1
billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net gains of $
406
million in the third quarter of 2024 and net gains of $
195
million in the first nine months of 2024 ($
329
million of net losses in the third quarter of 2023 and $
336
million of net losses in the first nine months of 2023).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
and realized gains or losses recorded in
interest and other, net
. The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $
5.2
billion as of September 28, 2024 ($
4.7
billion as of December 30, 2023), which approximated the fair value for these periods.
The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of September 28, 2024, was as follows:
1
Instruments not due at a single maturity date is comprised of money market fund deposits, which are classified as either short-term investments or cash and cash equivalents.
Equity Investments
1
Most of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments. Certain of the trading volume restrictions generally apply for as long as we own more than
1
% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from the rules of the respective exchange.
The components of gains (losses) on equity investments, net for each period were as follows:
1
Sale of equity investments and other includes initial fair value adjustments recorded upon a security becoming marketable, realized gains (losses) on sales of non-marketable equity investments and equity method investments, and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and distributions.

NAND Memory Business
We sold our
NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business) to SK hynix Inc. (SK hynix) which we deconsolidated upon closing the first phase of the transaction on December 29, 2021. We have a receivable within
other current assets
for the transaction's remaining proceeds of $
2.0
billion, which remains outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be in March 2025.
In connection with the transaction, we have a wafer manufacturing and sale agreement that includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $
500
million annually, and $
1.5
billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. We recorded a receivable related to these reimbursable costs due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $
92
million within
other current assets
as of September 28, 2024 ($
145
million recorded as of December 30, 2023).
Our quarterly qualitative impairment assessment for the third quarter of 2024 indicated that a more detailed quantitative analysis was necessary for certain of our reporting units, primarily due to the decline in our market capitalization below the carrying value of our net assets, as well as the decline in our Mobileye reporting unit's market capitalization below the carrying value of Mobileye's net assets. Our quantitative assessment was performed by measuring each reporting unit's fair value using either the income approach, the market approach, or a combination of both. When using the income approach, we tested the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available market data. As a result of our impairment tests, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $
2.8
billion in the third quarter of 2024 within restructuring and other, most of which related to our Mobileye reporting unit, as the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value. The process of valuing each reporting unit is inherently subjective as valuation models require the application of significant estimates and the use of unobservable inputs, including market segment share, projected financial information, and discount rates. No impairment was required for our other reporting units, even when considering a hypothetical increase in the discount rate of
1
%, which would cause a material decrease in the estimated fair value of the respective non-impaired reporting units. Finally, to corroborate our estimated fair value, we performed a market capitalization reconciliation as of September 28, 2024, concluding that the implied control premium was reasonable.
In the first quarter of 2024, as a result of modifying our segment reporting, we reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization. We concluded based on our pre-reorganization impairment test that goodwill was not impaired. As a result of our post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $
222
million in the first quarter of 2024 related to our Intel Foundry reporting unit as the estimated fair value of the new reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value, which now includes substantially all of our allocated property, plant, and equipment. The Intel Foundry reporting unit has
no
remaining goodwill. At the conclusion of our impairment assessment performed during the first quarter of 2024, the fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all remaining reporting units.
In the second quarter of 2024, we remarketed $
438
million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona. In accordance with loan agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, the bonds are unsecured general obligations. The bonds mature in 2049 and have a
4.00
% coupon. The bonds are subject to optional tender starting in February 2029 and mandatory tender in June 2029, at which time we may remarket the bonds for a new term period.
In the first quarter of 2024, we issued a total of $
2.6
billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprised of $
500
million in
5.00
% senior notes due 2031, $
900
million in
5.15
% senior notes due 2034 and $
1.2
billion in
5.60
% senior notes due 2054. All of our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.
In the first quarter of 2024, we expanded both our
5-year
$
5.0
billion revolving credit facility agreement and our
364-day
$
5.0
billion credit facility agreement, to $
7.0
billion and $
8.0
billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended by one year to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. These credit facilities are unsecured general obligations. The revolving credit facilities had
no
borrowings outstanding as of September 28, 2024 and
December 30, 2023

Assets and Liabilities Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
1
Level 1 investments consist of money market funds. Level 2 investments consist primarily of certificates of deposit, time deposits, commercial paper, notes, and bonds issued by financial institutions.
2
Level 1 investments consist of US Treasury securities. Level 2 investments consist primarily of non-US government debt.
Assets Measured and Recorded at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis
Our non-marketable equity securities, equity method investments, and certain non-financial assets—such as intangible assets, goodwill, and property, plant, and equipment—are recorded at fair value only if an impairment or observable price adjustment is recognized in the current period. If an observable price adjustment or impairment is recognized on our non-marketable equity securities during the period, we classify these assets as Level 3. Similarly, impairments recognized on our goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant, and equipment  are categorized as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy as we utilize unobservable inputs such as prospective financial information, market segment growth rates, and discount rates in the fair value measurement process.
Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis include non-marketable equity securities and equity method investments that have not been remeasured or impaired in the current period, grants receivable, certain other receivables, and issued debt. We classify the fair value of grants receivable as Level 2. The estimated fair value of these financial instruments approximates their carrying value. The aggregate carrying value of grants receivable as of September 28, 2024 was $
1.1
billion (the aggregate carrying value as of December 30, 2023 was $
559
million).

Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of $
1.0
billion related to litigation involving VLSI (see VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel below), and a charge of $
401
million related to an EC-imposed fine (see European Commission Competition Matter below). Excluding the VLSI claims, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.
In addition, in the second quarter of 2024, we accrued a charge of $780 million related to three separate confidential settlement agreements with R2, Third Point, and TRGP that we entered into in the third quarter of 2024 (see R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation below).

European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.
We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.
In April 2022 the EC appealed the General Court’s findings regarding rebates to the Court of Justice. In October 2024 the Court of Justice dismissed the EC’s appeal, upholding the judgment of the General Court.
In September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications were stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
Consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US and Canada. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions between 2018 and 2021 were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment in November 2023, ending the litigation. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” In August 2024, the district court dismissed plaintiffs’ complaint for failure to plead a viable claim. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in September 2024, which we moved to dismiss in October 2024. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect.
Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.
Litigation Related to Segment Reporting and Internal Foundry Model
A securities class action lawsuit was filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in May 2024 against us and certain officers following the modification of our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to our new internal foundry operating model. The plaintiff seeks monetary damages on behalf of all persons and entities that purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from January 25, 2024 through April 25, 2024, and generally alleges that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the growth and prospects of the Foundry business. In August 2024, the court ordered the case consolidated with a second, similar lawsuit in which the plaintiff seeks monetary damages on behalf of all purchasers of our common stock from January 25, 2024 through August 1, 2024. In September 2024, the court appointed co-lead counsel for the consolidated lawsuit and ordered them to file an amended consolidated complaint by the end of October 2024. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter.

Several stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the Delaware state and federal courts since the filing of the securities class action lawsuit, alleging that our directors and certain officers breached their fiduciary duties and violated the federal securities laws by making or allowing the statements that are challenged in the securities class action lawsuit. The complaints seek to recover damages from the defendants on behalf of Intel. By stipulation of the parties, the courts have ordered the derivative lawsuits stayed pending certain developments in the securities class action lawsuit.
Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI sought damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest. Intel prevailed on all eight patents and the court entered final judgment in April 2024. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:
▪
The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted Inter Partes Reviews (IPR) on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB’s decisions. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. No trial dates have been set.
▪
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. In September 2024, the court denied VLSI’s motion for a new trial. Other post-trial motions remain pending, and the court has not yet entered final judgment.
▪
The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents, and the court granted Intel’s motion that same month.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI’s case.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement to the Supreme People’s Court. The Supreme People’s Court has set an evidentiary hearing in October 2024.
Table of Contents
In July 2024, Intel filed suit against VLSI in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware requesting the court find Intel is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In September 2024, VLSI filed motions requesting that Intel’s complaint be dismissed, transferred, or stayed.
As of September 28, 2024, we have accrued a charge of approximately $1.0 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.
R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation
In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. In July 2024, the UK High Court of Justice found the UK part of R2’s European patent invalid. In February 2024, the Dusseldorf court found Intel’s processors infringe and issued an injunction and recall order against Intel and its customers. In March 2024, R2 asserted the same patent against Fujitsu and Amazon Web Services in Dusseldorf Regional Court, accusing Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids in the AWS suit; and Tiger Lake, Ice Lake, Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids in the Fujitsu suit. R2 seeks an injunction, recall and damages. Intel is indemnifying and defending its customers. In March 2024, Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. filed an action in the Tribunale di Milano seeking an order that Intel processors do not infringe R2’s patent. In May 2024, R2 filed suit in Milan against Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. and Italian affiliates of customers Dell, HP, and HPE, accusing Intel’s Ice Lake (server and client), Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, and Raptor Lake processors of infringing its patent, and requesting that its suit be consolidated with Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A.’s suit. R2 is requesting an injunction and damages. In April 2024, R2 filed an action against Intel and its customers Dell, HP, and HPE for patent infringement before the Tribunal Judiciaire of Paris. Intel and its customers filed a nullity action against the patent in France.
In light of the potential disruption to Intel’s and its customers’ businesses in Europe were the Dusseldorf Regional Court’s injunction and recall order to be enforced before a decision by the appeals court was expected, the significant delay expected before a decision by the appeals court, and the additional ongoing and potential litigation across other jurisdictions and with respect to other Intel processors and customers, in August 2024 Intel entered into three separate confidential agreements with R2, Third Point (the controlling shareholder) and TRGP Capital (a third-party organization funding the lawsuits) to resolve the injunction enforcement risk and related pending litigation, and provide for broad-based litigation peace with these entities, which included rights to other technology and services to Intel. Across the three agreements, Intel will pay an aggregate amount of $780 million.

This report should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our business, operating segments, risk factors, critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates, among other important information.
In Q3 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy - returning to process leadership. These initiatives include reducing headcount by approximately 16,500 employees as of Q3 2024, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio reviews of our businesses under a 'clean sheet' view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. We expect the total impact from headcount reduction initiatives to exceed 15% of our core Intel workforce by year end. As a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in Q3 2024 as follows:
▪
cash-based employee severance and related employee exit charges of $2.2 billion;
▪
non-cash charges directly resulting from our decision to exit manufacturing capabilities for internal-use test hardware, resulting in the impairment of certain construction in progress assets of $442 million; and
▪
non-cash charges associated with real estate consolidation and exits that resulted in the impairment of certain operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements of $86 million.
In Q3 2024, our consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:
▪
$3.1 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;
▪
$2.9 billion of non-cash charges, all of which were recorded as other charges in the restructuring and other line as presented in our Consolidated Condensed Statements of Income, which were associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (combined with the restructuring charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, our restructuring and other charges totaled $5.6 billion in Q3 2024 — see "Note 6: Restructuring and Other Charges" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements); and
▪
$9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for (benefit from) income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see "Note 7: Income Taxes" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements).
Our discussion regarding our segments' results of operations presented below excludes the $5.6 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our chief operating decision maker receives, views and uses information for decision making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.
"Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements of this Form 10-Q provides additional information about our operating segments, including the nature of segment revenues and expenses, and reconciles our segment revenues presented below to our total consolidated net revenues and our segment operating income (loss) presented below to our total consolidated operating income (loss) for each of the periods presented.
Separately, during and following Q3 2024, there has been a significant escalation in hostilities in Israel and the surrounding region. We continue to monitor the impact the geopolitical conflict could have on our operations in Israel, including potential disruption of our wafer fabrication facility and our product development centers. To date, while we have had a substantial number of our employees called for active military duty, we have not had a material interruption in either our manufacturing operations or our product development centers. As a significant portion of our revenues are generated from products on Intel 7 manufactured at our fabrication facility in Israel and we are not insured for business interruptions, a disruption of that facility could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Additionally, our property, plant, and equipment assets in Israel are self-insured and could be impacted from the conflict.
For additional key highlights of our results of operations, see "A Quarter in Review."

Consolidated Gross Margin
We derived a majority of our consolidated gross margin in Q3 2024 and in YTD 2024 from our Intel Products business sales through our CCG, DCAI, and NEX operating segments. Our consolidated gross margin dollars in Q3 2024 decreased by $4.0 billion, or 67%, compared to Q3 2023, and YTD 2024 decreased by $2.9 billion, or 20%, compared to YTD 2023. We regularly evaluate our process technology node capacities relative to projected market demand for our products and services. During Q3 2024, we concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon concluding an asset re-use assessment, we impaired certain construction in progress assets and accelerated depreciation for certain in use manufacturing assets that resulted in $3.1 billion of charges in Q3 2024.

includes a charge of $780 million that we recorded in YTD 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. In Q3 2023, we recorded a $401 million charge for an EC-imposed fine. Refer to "Note 14: Contingencies" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for information about these items. Also, in Q3 2023, we incurred a $353 million termination fee as we m
utually agreed with Tower to terminate the agreement we entered into during 2022 to acquire Tower due to our inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner.
Asset impairment charges
in Q3 2024 primarily includes cash and non-cash charges associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan, including $442 million of non-cash impairments of construction in progress assets associated with our decision to exit and outsource manufacturing capabilities for certain internal test hardware; and $86 million of non-cash impairments of operating leased assets and related leasehold improvements resulting from real estate consolidations and exits.
Real estate consolidations and exits did not materially change our operating lease liabilities and may result in future cash outlays for facility restoration or the relocation of operations.
In addition, we incurred non-cash impairments related to goodwill and acquired intangible assets of $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion in Q3 2024 and YTD 2024, respectively. Refer to "Note 10: Goodwill" and "Note 6: Restructuring and Other Charges" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information about these items
.
Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, Net
In
Q3 2024 and YTD 2024
, losses resulted primarily from impairment charges of non-marketable securities and on-going mark-to-market losses on marketable equity securities. For YTD 2024, we recognized a $336 million initial fair value adjustment within
sale of equity investments and other
upon Astera Labs, Inc. shares becoming marketable.
In Q3 2023 and YTD 2023, losses were primarily due to on-going mark to market losses on marketable equity securities.

Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes
In
Q3 2024
, we established a valuation allowance of $9.9 billion as a discrete non-cash tax expense against our US deferred tax assets. We assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets quarterly, weighing available positive and negative evidence. As a result of our assessment in
Q3 2024
, we determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recoverable based upon our three-year cumulative historical loss position as of September 28, 2024, largely resulting from the asset impairment and restructuring and other charges incurred during the quarter.
Our provision for taxes increased in
YTD 2024
compared to
YTD 2023
, primarily driven by the effects associated with the establishment of a valuation allowance against our US deferred tax assets in Q3 2024. Additionally, our
YTD 2024 provision for taxes and
YTD 2023 benefit from taxes included
R&D tax credits, which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on income before taxes.
Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for all periods presented were determined using an actual annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any, as we were unable to make a reliable estimate of our annual effective tax rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted annual income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in $11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us (see "Note 3: Non-Controlling Interests" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements). Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements including cash outlays associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan; non-controlling interest distributions; and potential acquisitions and strategic investments. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales after implementing our 2024 Restructuring Plan and related cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, which are designed to enable further operational efficiency and agility and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing leadership. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our total cash and short-term investments
and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives. These incentives typically require that we make significant capital investments in new facilities or expand existing facilities, and our related workforce. To the extent we delay or cancel any such projects, such as the delays we announced during
Q3 2024
to our projects in Germany, Poland and Malaysia, there may be a delay in our receipt of, or we may lose, the associated government incentives.
Recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy, on August 1, 2024, we announced our Board of Directors suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends on our common stock starting in Q4 2024. The Board of Directors reiterated our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.
In YTD 2024, we issued a total of
$2.6 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior notes and remarketed $438 million aggregate principal amount of other bonds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures.
In YTD 2024, we also
expanded both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of September 28, 2024, we had no commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. See "Note 11: Borrowings" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in investment-grade securities.
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:
Table of Contents
Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
Cash provided by operations in the first nine months of 2024 was lower compared to the first nine months of 2023 as we incurred a higher net loss that was partially offset by a higher amount of favorable operating cash flow adjustments
, in each case in the first nine months of 2024 relative to the first nine months of 2023.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from capital-related government incentives.
Cash used for investing activities was lower in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to a reduction in cash flows used for the purchases of short-term investments, and lower capital additi
ons, in each case during the first nine months of 2024 relative to the first nine months of 2023.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and payment of dividends to stockholders.
Cash provided by financing activities was higher in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the first nine months of 2023, primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions and reduced dividend payments. These cash favorable activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and certain other cash unfavorable financing activities in the first nine months of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related effects to income taxes and net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance. Non-GAAP adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests are calculated by adjusting for the minority stockholder portion of non-GAAP adjustments we make for relevant acquisition-related costs, share-based compensation, restructuring and other charges, and income tax effects, as applicable to each majority-owned subsidiary.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 28, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending September 28, 2024. As of September 28, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended September 28, 2024, no such plans or arrangements were
adopted
or
terminated
, including by modification.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
