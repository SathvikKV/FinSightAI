Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements
For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this Quarterly Report), the terms “Oracle,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Oracle Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries. This Quarterly Report contains statements that are not historical in nature, are predictive in nature, or that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or otherwise contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), and Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act). These include, among other things, statements regarding:
•
our expectation that we may acquire, and realize the anticipated benefits of acquiring, companies, products, services and technologies to further our corporate strategy as compelling opportunities become available;
•
our expectation that, on a constant currency basis, our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to expected growth in our cloud services and continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings;
•
our expectation that substantially all of our customers will renew their license support contracts upon expiration;
•
our expectation that current and expected customer demand will require continued growth in our cloud services and license support expenses in order to increase our existing data center capacity and establish additional data centers in new geographic locations;
•
our expectation that our hardware business will have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business;

our expectation that the proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues will continue to increase;
•
the sufficiency of our sources of funding for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual obligations, acquisitions, dividends, stock repurchases, debt repayments and other matters;
•
our belief that we have adequately provided under United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles for outcomes related to our tax audits, that the final outcome of our tax-related examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations, and that our net deferred tax assets will likely be realized in the foreseeable future;
•
our belief that the outcome of certain legal proceedings and claims to which we are a party will not, individually or in the aggregate, result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any;
•
the possibility that certain legal proceedings to which we are a party could have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations;
•
the timing and amount of expenses we expect to incur;
•
the cost savings we expect to realize pursuant to the Fiscal 2024 Oracle Restructuring Plan;

•
our ability to predict revenues, particularly certain cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues;
•
the percentages of remaining performance obligations that we expect to recognize as revenues over respective future periods;
as well as other statements regarding our future operations, financial condition and prospects, and business strategies. Forward-looking statements may be preceded by, followed by or include the words “anticipates,” “believes,” “commits,” “continues,” “could,” “endeavors,” “estimates,” “expects,” “goal,” “intends,” “is designed to,” “likely,” “maintains,” “may,” “plans,” “potential,” “seeks,” “shall,” “should,” “strives,” “will” and similar expressions.

These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions about our business that could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in “Risk Factors” included in documents we file from time to time with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 and our other Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q to be filed by us in our fiscal year 2025, which runs from June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025.
We have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or risks, except to the extent required by applicable securities laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. New information, future events or risks could cause the forward-looking events we discuss in this Quarterly Report not to occur. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which reflect our expectations only as of the date of this Quarterly Report.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION, RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
AND OTHER
Basis of Presentation
We have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements included herein pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States (U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, we believe that the disclosures herein are adequate to ensure the information presented is not misleading. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
We believe that all necessary adjustments, which consisted only of normal recurring items, have been included in the accompanying financial statements to present fairly the results of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the operating results to be expected for any subsequent interim period or for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025.
There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31,
2024 that had a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements or notes thereto as of and for the three months ended August 31, 2024.
Use of Estimates
Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP as set forth in the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), and we consider various staff accounting bulletins and other applicable guidance issued by the SEC. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and networking equipment and increased the estimate of the useful lives from
five years
to
six years
, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2025. Based on the carrying value of our servers and networking equipment as of May 31, 2024, this change in accounting estimate decreased our total operating expenses by $
197
million and increased our net income by $
157
million, or $
0.06
per both basic and diluted share, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash
Restricted cash that was included within cash and cash equivalents as presented within our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 and our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 was immaterial.

Remaining Performance Obligations from Contracts with Customers
Trade receivables, net of allowance for credit losses, and deferred revenues are reported net of related uncollected deferred revenues in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024. The revenues recognized during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balances as of May 31, 2024 and 2023 were approximately $
3.9
billion during each period. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial in each of the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023.
Remaining performance obligations, as defined in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, were $
99.1
billion as of August 31, 2024, of which we expect to recognize approximately
38
% as revenues over the next
twelve months
,
38
% over the subsequent month
13 to month 36
,
19
% over the subsequent month
37 to month 60
and the remainder thereafter.
Sales of Financing Receivables
We offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts’ dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. Financing receivables sold to financial institutions were $
595
million and $
561
million for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.
Non-Marketable Investments
Our non-marketable debt investments and equity securities and related instruments totaled $
2.3
billion and $
2.0
billion as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, and are included in other non-current assets in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets and are subject to periodic credit losses and impairment reviews. Certain of these non-marketable equity securities and related instruments are adjusted for observable price changes from orderly transactions. The majority of the non-marketable investments held as of these dates were with Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity in which we have an ownership interest of approximately
29
% as of August 31, 2024. We follow the equity method of accounting for our investment in Ampere and our share of loss under the equity method of accounting is recorded in the non-operating income (expenses), net line item in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. We also have convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in
June 2026
and are convertible into equity securities at the holder’s option under certain circumstances. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we invested $
75
million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting was $
1.5
billion as of August 31, 2024. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $
450
million to $
1.5
billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through
January 2027
. If either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operations. Ampere has historically generated net losses.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
We perform fair value measurements in accordance with FASB ASC 820,
Fair Value Measurement
. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at their fair values, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact and consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the assets or liabilities, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and risk of nonperformance.
ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. An asset’s or a liability’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:
•
Level 1:  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•
Level 2:  inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; or
•
Level 3:  unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair values of the assets or liabilities.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis
Our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (Level 1 and Level 2 inputs are defined above):

Our cash equivalents and marketable securities investments consist of money market funds, time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities. Marketable securities as presented per our condensed consolidated balance sheets included debt securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than three months and the remainder of the debt securities were included in cash and cash equivalents. We classify our marketable debt securities as available-for-sale debt securities at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification as of each balance sheet date. As of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, all of our marketable debt securities investments mature within one year. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of our instruments that were classified as Level 1 in the table above were derived from quoted market prices and active markets for these instruments that exist. Our valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of Level 2 instruments listed in the table above were derived from the following: non-binding market consensus prices that were corroborated by observable market data, quoted market prices for similar instruments, or pricing models, such as discounted cash flow techniques, with all significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data including reference rate yield curves, among others.
Based on the trading prices of the $
84.5
billion and $
86.5
billion of senior notes and other long-term borrowings and the related fair value hedges that we had outstanding as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively, the estimated fair values of the senior notes and other long-term borrowings and the related fair value hedges using Level 2 inputs at August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024 were $
77.7
billion and $
77.2
billion, respectively.
3.
RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES
Fiscal 2024 Oracle Restructuring Plan
During fiscal 2024, our management approved, committed to and initiated plans to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations due to our acquisitions and certain other operational activities (2024 Restructuring Plan). The total estimated restructuring costs associated with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are up to $
635
million and will be recorded to the restructuring expense line item within our condensed consolidated statements of operations as they are incurred through the end of the plan. We recorded $
76
million and $
153
million of restructuring expenses in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Any changes to the estimates of executing the 2024 Restructuring Plan will be reflected in our future results of operations.
Summary of All Plans
(1)
Restructuring costs recorded to each of the operating segments presented primarily related to employee severance costs. Other restructuring costs represented employee severance costs not related to our operating segments and certain other restructuring plan costs.

Other restructuring plans presented in the tables above included condensed information for other Oracle based plans and other plans associated with certain of our acquisitions whereby we continued to make cash outlays to settle obligations under these plans during the periods presented but for which the periodic impact to our condensed consolidated statements of operations was not significant.
4.
DEFERRED REVENUES
Deferred revenues consisted of the following:
Deferred cloud services and license support revenues and deferred hardware revenues substantially represent customer payments made in advance for cloud or support contracts that are typically billed in advance with corresponding revenues generally being recognized ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual periods. Deferred services revenues include prepayments for our services business and revenues for these services are generally recognized as the services are performed. Deferred cloud license and on-premise license revenues typically resulted from customer payments that related to undelivered products and services or specified enhancements.
5.
STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY
Common Stock Repurchases
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of August 31, 2024, approximately $
6.8
billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program. We repurchased
1.1
million shares for $
150
million during the three months ended August 31, 2024 and
1.3
million shares for $
150
million during the three months ended August 31, 2023 under the stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.

Dividends on Common Stock
In September 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $
0.40
per share of our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on
October 24, 2024
to stockholders of record as of the close of business on
October 10, 2024
. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
Fiscal 2025 Stock‑Based Awards Activity and Compensation Expense
During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we issued
3
million restricted stock-based units (RSUs), all of which are subject to service-based vesting restrictions. These fiscal 2025 stock-based award issuances were partially offset by stock-based award forfeitures and cancellations of
1
million shares during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
The RSUs that were granted during the three months ended August 31, 2024 have similar vesting restrictions and contractual lives and were valued using methodologies of a similar nature as those described in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
Stock-based compensation expense is included in the following operating expense line items in our condensed consolidated statements of operations:

INCOME TAXES
Our effective tax rates for each of the periods presented are the result of the mix of income and losses earne
d in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Our (provision for) benefit from income taxes varied from the tax computed at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate for the periods presented primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction and the tax effect of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income. Our effective tax rate was
7.6
% for the three months ended August 31, 2024, and our effective tax benefit rate was (
1.9
%) for the three months ended August 31, 2023.
Our net deferred tax assets were $
8.8
billion and $
8.6
billion as of August 31, 2024 and May 31, 2024, respectively. We believe that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized in the foreseeable future. Realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. The amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable is subject to adjustment in future periods if estimates of future taxable income change.
Domestically, U.S. federal and state taxing authorities are currently examining income tax returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2022. Our U.S. federal income tax returns have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2013 and, with some exceptions, we are no longer subject to audit for those periods. Our U.S. state income tax returns, with some exceptions, have been examined for all years prior to fiscal 2010, and we are no longer subject to audit for those periods.
Internationally, tax authorities for numerous non-U.S. jurisdictions are also examining or have examined returns of Oracle and various acquired entities for years through fiscal 2024. Many of the relevant tax years are at an advanced stage in examination or subsequent controversy resolution processes. With some exceptions, we are generally no longer subject to tax examinations in non-U.S. jurisdictions for years prior to fiscal 2001.
We are under audit by the IRS and various other domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to income tax and indirect tax matters and are involved in various challenges and litigation in a number of countries, including, in particular, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Germany, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Spain, where the amounts under controversy are significant. In some, although not all, cases, we have reserved for potential adjustments to our provision for income taxes and accrual of indirect taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax authorities or final outcomes in judicial proceedings and we believe that the final outcome of these examinations, agreements or judicial proceedings will not have a material effect on our results of operations. If events occur which indicate payment of these amounts is unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in the recognition of benefits in the period we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimates of the federal, state and foreign income tax liabilities and indirect tax liabilities are less than the ultimate assessment, it could result in a further charge to expense.
We believe that we have adequately provided under GAAP for outcomes related to our tax audits. However, there can be no assurances as to the possible outcomes or any related financial statement effect thereof.

SEGMENT INFORMATION
ASC 280,
Segment Reporting
, establishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision makers (CODMs) are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer. We are organized by line of business and geographically. While our CODMs evaluate results in a number of different ways, the line of business management structure is the primary basis for which the allocation of resources and financial results are assessed. The tabular information below presents financial information that is provided to our CODMs for their review and assists our CODMs with evaluating the company’s performance and allocating company resources
.
We have three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—each of which is comprised of a single operating segment. All three of our businesses market and sell our offerings globally to businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers with a worldwide sales force positioned to offer the combinations that best meet customer needs.
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale, marketing and delivery of our enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through cloud and on-premise deployment models including our cloud services and license support offerings; and our cloud license and on-premise license offerings. Cloud services and license support revenues are generated from offerings that are typically contracted with customers directly, billed to customers in advance, delivered to customers over time with our revenue recognition occurring over the contractual terms and renewed by customers upon completion of the contractual terms. Cloud services and license support contracts provide customers with access to the latest updates to the applications and infrastructure technologies as they become available and for which the customer contracted and also include related technical support services over the contractual term. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments. We generally recognize revenues at the point in time the software is made available to the customer to download and use, which typically is immediate upon signature of the license contract. In each fiscal year, our cloud and license business’ contractual activities are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and the related cash flows are typically highest in the following quarter (i.e., in the first fiscal quarter of the next fiscal year) as we receive payments from these contracts.
Our hardware business provides infrastructure technologies including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software to support diverse IT environments. Our hardware business also offers hardware support, which provides customers with software updates for the software components that are essential to the functionality of their hardware products and can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services that are typically delivered and recognized ratably over the contractual term.
Our services business provides services to customers and partners to help maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies.
We do not track our assets for each business. Consequently, it is not practical to show assets by operating segment.

Disaggregation of Revenues
We have considered information that is regularly reviewed by our CODMs in evaluating financial performance and disclosures presented outside of our financial statements in our earnings releases and used in investor presentations to disaggregate revenues to depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows are affected by economic factors. The principal category we use to disaggregate revenues is the nature of our products and services as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
The following table is a summary of our total revenues by geographic region:

EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income for the period by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding restricted stock-based awards, stock options and shares issuable under the employee stock purchase plan as applicable pursuant to the treasury stock method. The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s NetSuite Acquisition
On May 3 and July 18, 2017, two alleged stockholders filed separate derivative lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf. Thereafter, the court consolidated the two derivative cases and designated the July 18, 2017 complaint as the operative complaint. The consolidated lawsuit was brought against all the then-current members and one former member of our Board of Directors, and Oracle as a nominal defendant. Plaintiff alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by causing Oracle to agree to purchase NetSuite Inc. at an excessive price. The complaint sought (and the operative complaint continues to seek) declaratory relief, unspecified monetary damages (including interest) and attorneys’ fees and costs. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the court denied on March 19, 2018.
On May 4, 2018, our Board of Directors established a Special Litigation Committee (SLC) to investigate the allegations in this derivative action. Three non-employee directors served on the SLC. On August 15, 2019, the SLC filed a letter with the court, stating that the SLC believed that plaintiff should be allowed to proceed with the derivative litigation on behalf of Oracle. After the SLC advised the Board that it had fulfilled its duties and obligations, the Board withdrew the SLC’s authority, except that the SLC maintained certain authority to respond to discovery requests in the litigation.
After plaintiff filed the July 18, 2017 complaint, an additional plaintiff joined the case. Plaintiffs filed several amended complaints and filed their final amended complaint on December 11, 2020. The final amended complaint asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty against our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer, the estate of Mark Hurd (our former Chief Executive Officer who passed away on October 18, 2019) and two other members of our Board of Directors. Oracle is named as a nominal defendant. On December 11, 2020, the estate of Mark Hurd and the two other members of our Board of Directors moved to dismiss this complaint. On June 21, 2021, the court granted this motion as to the estate of Mark Hurd and one Board member and denied the motion as to the other Board member, who filed an answer to the complaint on August 9, 2021. On December 28, 2020, our Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Technology Officer and Oracle as a nominal defendant filed answers to the operative complaint.

Trial commenced on July 18, 2022, and on November 18, 2022, the court held a final hearing on the parties’ post-trial briefing. On December 27, 2022, the court “so ordered” a stipulation, dismissing the Board member from this action. On May 12, 2023, the court issued its trial ruling, finding for defendants and rejecting plaintiffs’ claims. The court entered judgment for defendants on March 5, 2024. On April 2, 2024, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, appealing the court’s judgment and certain discovery decisions relating to the SLC. On May 2, 2024, plaintiffs filed their opening appellate brief. On June 3, 2024, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer filed their opposition brief, and the SLC filed an opposition brief on the discovery issues. On July 10, 2024, plaintiffs filed their reply brief. The Supreme Court of Delaware, sitting en banc, will hear oral argument on October 23, 2024.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Derivative Litigation Concerning Oracle’s Cloud Business
On February 12 and May 6, 2019, two stockholder derivative lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The cases were consolidated, and on July 8, 2019, a single plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. The consolidated complaint brought various claims relating to a Rule 10b-5 class action that was filed in the same court on August 10, 2018, and which was settled for a payment by Oracle of $
17,500,000
. That matter is now concluded. In the Rule 10b-5 class action, plaintiff alleged Oracle and certain Oracle officers made or were responsible for false and misleading statements regarding Oracle’s cloud business.
Plaintiff in the derivative action filed an amended complaint on June 4, 2021. The derivative suit is brought by an alleged stockholder of Oracle, purportedly on Oracle’s behalf, against our Chief Technology Officer, our Chief Executive Officer and the estate of Mark Hurd. Plaintiff claims that the alleged actions described in the 10b-5 class action caused harm to Oracle, including harming Oracle because Oracle allegedly repurchased its own stock at an inflated price. Plaintiff also claims that defendants violated their fiduciary duties of candor, good faith, loyalty, and due care by failing to prevent this alleged harm. Plaintiff also brings derivative claims for violations of federal securities laws. Plaintiff seeks a ruling that this case may proceed as a derivative action, a finding that defendants are liable for breaching their fiduciary duties, an award of damages to Oracle, an order directing defendants to enact corporate reforms, attorneys’ fees and costs, and unspecified relief. The parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle this case, under which Oracle will implement certain corporate governance measures, which shall remain in place for
five years
, and Oracle will pay plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs of no more than $
700,000
. On April 5, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. On August 8, 2024, the court held a hearing where it granted plaintiffs’ motion and preliminarily approved the settlement. A final fairness hearing is scheduled for November 14, 2024.
While Oracle continues to evaluate these claims, we do not believe these matters will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Netherlands Privacy Class Action
On August 14, 2020, The Privacy Collective (TPC), a foundation having its registered office in Amsterdam, filed a purported class action lawsuit against Oracle Nederland B.V, Oracle Corporation and Oracle America, Inc. (the Oracle Defendants), Salesforce.com, Inc. and SFDC Netherlands B.V. in the District Court of Amsterdam. TPC alleges that the Oracle Defendants’ Data Management Platform product violates certain articles of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, the General Data Protection Regulation and the Dutch Telecommunications Act (Telecommunicatiewet). TPC claims damages under a number of categories, including: “immaterial damages” (at a fixed amount of €
500
per Dutch internet user); “material damages” (in that the costs of loss of control over personal data should be equated to the market value of the personal data for parties like the Oracle Defendants); compensation for losses suffered due to an alleged data breach (at a fixed amount of €
100
per
Dutch internet user);

and
compensation for the costs of the litigation funder (
10
% to
25
% of the compensation awarded); and the (actual) cost of the proceedings and extrajudicial costs.
We filed our defense on March 3, 2021, and on December 29, 2021, the District Court issued a judgment, holding that all of TPC’s claims were deemed inadmissible because of fundamental procedural flaws. TPC filed an appeal with the Court of Appeal in Amsterdam challenging the District Court’s judgment, except for the claims regarding the alleged data breach, which were dropped.  On June 18, 2024, the Court of Appeal overturned the District Court’s decision regarding admissibility, thus permitting the case to proceed. We requested that the Court of Appeal permit an interim appeal to the Dutch Supreme Court and/or the European Court of Justice, and the Court of Appeal has not yet ruled on this request. We believe that we have meritorious defenses against this action, including defenses to the quantum of damages claimed, and we will continue to vigorously defend it.
While the final outcome of this matter cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot estimate a range of loss at this time, we do not believe that it will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations.
Other Litigation
We are party to various other legal proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including proceedings and claims that relate to acquisitions we have completed or to companies we have acquired or are attempting to acquire. While the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the outcome of any of these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will result in losses that are materially in excess of amounts already recognized, if any.

Item 2. 	Management’s Discussion and Analysis o
f Financial Condition and Results of Operations
We begin Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations with an overview of our businesses and significant trends. This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting estimates that we believe are important to understanding significant assumptions and judgments incorporated in our reported financial results. We then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition.
Business Overview
Oracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) needs. Our products and services include enterprise applications and infrastructure offerings that are delivered worldwide through a variety of flexible and interoperable IT deployment models. These models include on-premise, cloud-based and hybrid deployments (an approach that combines both on-premise and cloud-based deployments). Accordingly, we offer choice and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers’ needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.
We have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 2 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the information contained within Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which are our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and license business, which represented 84% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:
•
Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:
o
cloud services revenues, which are earned by providing customers access to Oracle Cloud applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment models that Oracle develops, provides unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that customers access by entering into a subscription agreement with us for a stated period. Oracle Cloud Applications and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (collectively Oracle Cloud Services) arrangements generally: are billed in advance of the cloud services being delivered; have durations of one to four years; are renewed at the customer’s option; and are recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period of the cloud contract or, in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed over time; and
o
license support revenues, which are earned by providing Oracle license support services to customers that have elected to purchase support services in connection with the purchase of Oracle applications and infrastructure software licenses for use in cloud, on-premise and other IT environments. Substantially all license support customers renew their support contracts with us upon expiration in order to continue to benefit from technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally: priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; billed in advance of the support services being performed; renewed at the customer’s option; and recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year.
•
Cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which include revenues from the licensing of our software products including Oracle Applications, Oracle Database, Oracle Middleware and Java, among others, which our customers deploy within cloud-based, on-premise or other IT environments. Our cloud license and on-premise license transactions are generally perpetual in nature and are generally recognized as revenues up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. Revenues from usage-based royalty arrangements for distinct cloud licenses and on-premise licenses are
22
Table of Contents
recognized at the point in time when the software end user usage occurs. The timing of a few large license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly license revenues due to the point-in-time nature of revenue recognition for license transactions, which is different than the typical revenue recognition pattern for our cloud services and license support revenues in which revenues are recognized over time. Cloud license and on-premise license customers have the option to purchase and renew license support contracts, as further described above.
Providing choice and flexibility to our customers as to when and how they deploy Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies are important elements of our corporate strategy. In recent periods, customer demand for our applications and infrastructure technologies delivered through our Oracle Cloud Services has increased. To address customer demand and enable customer choice, we have certain programs for customers to pivot their applications and infrastructure software licenses and the related license support to the Oracle Cloud for new deployments and to migrate to and expand with the Oracle Cloud for their existing workloads. The proportion of our cloud services revenues relative to our total revenues has increased and we expect this trend to continue. Cloud services revenues represented 42% and 37% of our total revenues in the first three months of fiscal 2025 and 2024, respectively.
Our cloud and license business’ revenue growth is affected by many factors, including the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; the strategy for and competitive position of our offerings; customer satisfaction with our offerings; the continued renewal of our cloud services and license support customer contracts by the customer contract base; substantially all customers continuing to purchase license support contracts in connection with their license purchases; the pricing of license support contracts sold in connection with the sales of licenses; the pricing, amounts and volumes of licenses and cloud services sold; our ability to manage Oracle Cloud capacity requirements to meet existing and prospective customer demand; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
On a constant currency basis, we expect that our total cloud and license revenues generally will continue to increase due to:
•
expected growth in our cloud services offerings; and
•
continued demand for our cloud license and on-premise license and license support offerings.
We believe these factors should contribute to future growth in our cloud and license business’ total revenues, which should enable us to continue to make investments in research and development and our cloud operations to develop, improve, increase the capacity of and expand the geographic footprint of our cloud and license products and services.
Our cloud and license business’ margin has historically trended upward over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year due to the historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over those quarterly periods and because the majority of our costs for this business are generally fixed in the short term. The historical upward trend of our cloud and license business’ revenues over the course of the four quarters within a particular fiscal year is primarily due to the addition of new cloud services and license support contracts to the customer contract base that we generally recognize as revenues ratably or based upon customer usage over the respective contractual terms and the renewal of existing customers’ cloud services and license support contracts over the course of each fiscal year that we generally recognize as revenues in a similar manner; and the historical upward trend of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues, which we generally recognize at a point in time upon delivery; in each case over those four fiscal quarterly periods.
Hardware Business
Our hardware business, which represented 6% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, provides a broad selection of enterprise hardware products and hardware-related software products including Oracle Engineered Systems, servers, storage, industry-specific hardware offerings, operating systems, virtualization, management and other hardware-related software and related hardware support. Each hardware product and its related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product and its related software are delivered to the customer and ownership
23
Table of Contents
is transferred to the customer. We expect to continue to make investments in research and development to improve existing hardware products and services and to develop new hardware products and services. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels, including independent distributors and value-added resellers. Our hardware support offerings provide customers with unspecified software updates for software components that are essential to the functionality of our hardware products and associated software products. Our hardware support offerings can also include product repairs, maintenance services and technical support services. Hardware support contracts are entered into and renewed at the option of the customer, are generally priced as a percentage of the net hardware products fees and are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual terms.
We generally expect our hardware business to have lower operating margins as a percentage of revenues than our cloud and license business due to the incremental costs we incur to produce and distribute these products and to provide support services, including direct materials and labor costs.
Our quarterly hardware revenues are difficult to predict. Our hardware revenues, cost of hardware and hardware operating margins that we report are affected by many factors, including our manufacturing partners’ abilities to timely manufacture or deliver a few large hardware transactions; our strategy for and the position of our hardware products relative to competitor offerings; customer demand for competing offerings, including cloud infrastructure offerings; the strength of general economic and business conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; whether customers decide to purchase hardware support contracts at or in close proximity to the time of hardware product sale; the percentage of our hardware support contract customer base that renews its support contracts; and the close association between hardware products, which have a finite life, and customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products age; customer decisions to either maintain or upgrade their existing hardware infrastructure to newly developed technologies that are available; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Services Business
Our services business, which represented 10% of our total revenues on a trailing 4-quarter basis, helps customers and partners maximize the performance of their investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies. We believe that our services are differentiated based on our focus on Oracle technologies, extensive experience, broad sets of intellectual property and best practices. Our services offerings include consulting services and advanced customer services. Our services business has lower margins than our cloud and license and hardware businesses. Our services revenues are affected by many factors including our strategy for, and the competitive position of, our services; customer demand for our cloud and license and hardware offerings and the related services that we may market and sell in connection with these offerings; general economic conditions; governmental budgetary constraints; personnel reductions in our customers’ IT departments; tighter controls over customer discretionary spending; and foreign currency rate fluctuations.
Acquisitions
Our selective and active acquisition program is another important element of our corporate strategy. Historically, we have invested billions of dollars to acquire a number of complementary companies, products, services and technologies. As compelling opportunities become available, we may acquire companies, products, services and technologies in furtherance of our corporate strategy.
We believe that we can fund our future acquisitions with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities. We estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings, operating margin, cash flows and return on invested capital targets, among others, before deciding to move forward with an acquisition.

Investment in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC
From time to time since 2017, we have made investments in Ampere Computing Holdings LLC (Ampere), a related party entity, in the form of equity and convertible debt instruments. The total carrying value of our investments in Ampere, after accounting for losses under the equity method of accounting, was $1.5 billion as of August 31, 2024. We currently expect Ampere to continue to generate net losses in future periods but we remain confident in the long-term potential of Ampere’s server chips.
Our equity investments in Ampere represent an ownership interest of approximately 29% as of August 31, 2024. We also own convertible debt investments in Ampere which, under the terms of an agreement with Ampere and other co-investors, will mature in June 2026 and are convertible into equity securities at the holder’s option under certain circumstances. During the three months ended August 31, 2024, we invested $75 million in convertible debt instruments issued by Ampere. In accordance with the terms of an agreement with other co-investors, we are also a counterparty to certain put (exercisable by a co-investor) and call (exercisable by Oracle) options at prices of approximately $450 million to $1.5 billion, respectively, to acquire additional equity interests in Ampere from our co-investors through January 2027. If either of such options is exercised by us or our co-investors, we would obtain control of Ampere and consolidate its results with our results of operations.
Critical Accounting Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which requires us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had, or are reasonably likely to have, a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. To the extent that there are differences between these estimates, judgments or assumptions and actual results, our financial statements will be affected. We have critical accounting estimates in the areas of business combinations, income taxes and non-marketable investments.
During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and increased the estimated useful lives from five years to six years, effective at the beginning of fiscal 2025. Refer to Note 1 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for more information. There were no other significant changes to our critical accounting estimates. Refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates” under Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for a more complete discussion of our critical accounting estimates.
Results of Operations
Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information
In our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our condensed consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.
In addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses—cloud and license, hardware and services—which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280,
Segment Reporting
. The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.
Consistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, interest expense, non-operating income (expenses), net and (provision for) benefit from income taxes are not attributed to our three

operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to “Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges” below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 7 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our condensed consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented.
Constant Currency Presentation
Our international operations have provided, and are expected to continue to provide, a significant portion of each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses. As a result, each of our businesses’ revenues and expenses and our total revenues and expenses will continue to be affected by changes in the U.S. Dollar against major international currencies. In order to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this Quarterly Report using constant currency. To present this information, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. Dollars are converted into U.S. Dollars at constant exchange rates (i.e., the rates in effect on May 31, 2024, which was the last day of our prior fiscal year) rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods. For example, if an entity reporting in Euros had revenues of 1.0 million Euros from products sold on August 31, 2024 and 2023, our financial statements would reflect reported revenues of $1.11 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (using 1.11 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period) and $1.08 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (using 1.08 as the applicable average exchange rate for the period). The constant currency presentation, however, would translate the results for each of the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 using the May 31, 2024 exchange rate and indicate, in this example, no change in revenues between the periods compared. In each of the tables below, we present the percent change based on actual, unrounded results in reported currency and in constant currency.
Total Revenues and Operating Expenses
(1)
Comprised of Europe, the Middle East and Africa
Total revenues increased by $854 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to a $1.0 billion increase in cloud and license revenues, partially offset by a decrease in hardware and services revenues by $59 million and $120 million, respectively. Excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations of 1%, the increase in our cloud and license business in the first quarter of fiscal
26
Table of Contents
2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, was primarily due to growth in our cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and also renewed their related cloud contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 30% and 70%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. In our hardware business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies. In our services business, the constant currency decrease in revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 was attributable to a decrease in revenues from each of our primary services offerings. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 63%, 23% and 14%, respectively, of the constant currency total revenue growth during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
Total GAAP operating expenses increased by $159 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase in GAAP operating expenses was due to a $418 million increase in cloud services and license support expenses primarily due to higher infrastructure expenses that were incurred to support the increase in our cloud services revenues and higher employee related expenses, including increased expenses relating to stock-based compensation, and a $90 million increase in research and development expenses primarily due to higher employee related expenses. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a $139 million decrease in expenses for amortization of intangible assets as certain of our assets were fully amortized; a $65 million decrease in services expenses primarily due to lower external contractor expenses; a $65 million decrease in restructuring expenses; a $57 million decrease in hardware expenses primarily due to lower hardware product and support costs; and a $35 million decrease in general and administrative expenses.
In constant currency, our total operating margin and total operating margin as a percentage of revenues increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to higher revenues.
Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges
To supplement our condensed consolidated financial information, we believe that the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future.
Our operating results reported pursuant to GAAP included the following business combination accounting adjustments and expenses related to acquisitions and certain other expenses, including stock-based compensation, that affected our GAAP net income:

Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments including certain adjustments after the measurement period has ended and certain other operating items, net.
(3)
Restructuring expenses in each of the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 primarily related to employee severance in connection with the Fiscal 2024 Oracle Restructuring Plan (2024 Restructuring Plan). Additional information regarding certain of our restructuring plans is provided in management’s discussion below under “Restructuring Expenses,” in Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and in Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
(4)
Stock-based compensation was included in the following operating expense line items of our condensed consolidated statements of operations (in millions):
(5)
For all periods presented, the applicable jurisdictional tax rates applied to our income before income taxes after excluding the tax effects of items within the table above such as for stock-based compensation, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring, and certain acquisition related and other items, and after excluding the net deferred tax effects associated with a previously recorded income tax benefit that resulted from a partial realignment of our legal entity structure. These adjustments resulted in effective tax rates of 18.9% and 18.8%, instead of 7.6% and (1.9%), respectively, for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and 2024, which represented our effective tax expense (benefit) rates as derived per our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Cloud and License Business
Our cloud and license business engages in the sale and marketing of our applications and infrastructure technologies that are delivered through various deployment models and include: Oracle Cloud Services offerings; Oracle cloud license and on-premise license offerings; and Oracle license support offerings. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that we develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one to four years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses, generally on a perpetual basis, to use our database and middleware and our applications software products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. License support revenues are typically generated through the sale of applications and infrastructure software license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct sales through our own sales force. We also continue to market certain of our offerings through indirect channels. Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings and marketing program costs.

Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above.
Our cloud and license business’ total revenues increased by $1.0 billion in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to a $988 million increase in cloud services revenues as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies and renewed their related cloud contracts to continue to gain access to the latest versions of our technologies for which we delivered such cloud services during the period presented and a $61 million increase in our cloud license and on-premise license revenues. In constant currency, applications cloud services and license support and infrastructure cloud services and license support contributed 30% and 70%, respectively, of the growth in cloud services and license support revenues during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. License support revenues decreased slightly by $16 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. In constant currency, the Americas, the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions contributed 70%, 19% and 11%, respectively, of the revenue growth for this business during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
Total cloud and license business’ expenses increased by $369 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of less than 1%, the constant currency increase in expenses was primarily due to a $255 million increase in infrastructure expenses and a $75 million increase in employee related expenses to support the increase in our cloud services revenues. Our cloud services and license support expenses have grown in recent periods, and we expect this trend to continue during fiscal 2025 as we increase our existing data center capacity and establish data centers in new geographic locations in order to meet current and expected customer demand.
Excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations, our cloud and license business’ total margin increased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to increases in total revenues for this business. In constant currency, total margin as a percentage of revenues remained flat in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.

Hardware Business
Our hardware business’ revenues are generated from the sales of our Oracle Engineered Systems, server, storage and industry-specific hardware offerings. The hardware product and related software, such as an operating system or firmware, are highly interdependent and interrelated and are accounted for as a combined performance obligation. The revenues for this combined performance obligation are generally recognized at the point in time that the hardware product is delivered to the customer and ownership is transferred to the customer. Our hardware business also earns revenues from the sale of hardware support contracts purchased by our customers at their option and that are generally recognized as revenues ratably as the hardware support services are delivered over the contractual term, which is generally one year. The majority of our hardware products are sold through indirect channels such as independent distributors and value-added resellers and we also market and sell our hardware products through our direct sales force. Operating expenses associated with our hardware business include the cost of hardware products, which consists of expenses for materials and labor used to produce these products by our internal manufacturing operations or by third-party manufacturers, warranty and related expenses and the impact of periodic changes in inventory valuation, including the impact of inventory determined to be excess and obsolete; the cost of materials used to repair customer products with eligible support contracts; the cost of labor and infrastructure to provide support services; and sales and marketing expenses, which are largely personnel related and include variable compensation earned by our sales force for the sales of our hardware offerings.

Also excludes amortization of intangible assets and certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above.
Total hardware revenues decreased by $59 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the unfavorable impact of currency rate fluctuation of less than 1%, the decrease in hardware revenues was primarily due to our continued emphasis on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of hardware support contracts sold in recent periods. Geographically, we experienced constant currency hardware revenue decline in the Americas region, partially offset by increase in the EMEA region. Constant currency hardware revenue remained flat in the Asia Pacific region in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024.
Total hardware expenses decreased by $64 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable currency rate fluctuations effect of 1%, the constant currency decrease in hardware expenses was primarily due to a $57 million decrease in hardware product and support costs, which aligned with lower hardware revenues.

Services Business
Our services offerings are designed to help maximize the performance of customer investments in Oracle applications and infrastructure technologies and include our consulting services and advanced customer services offerings. Services revenues are generally recognized over time as the services are performed. The cost of providing our services consists primarily of personnel related expenses, technology infrastructure expenditures, facilities expenses and external contractor expenses.

Excludes stock-based compensation and certain allocations. Also excludes certain other GAAP-based expenses, which were not allocated to our operating segment results for purposes of reporting to and review by our CODMs, as further described under “Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information” above.
Total services revenues decreased by $120 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency rate fluctuations of 1%, the decrease in total services revenues was due to a decrease in revenues in each of our primary services offerings. The constant currency decrease in services revenues in the Americas region was partially offset by constant currency increases in services revenues in the EMEA and the Asia Pacific regions in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
Total services expenses decreased by $79 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of 1%, the decrease in services expenses was primarily due to a decrease in external contractor expenses of $65 million.
In constant currency, our services business’ total margin and total margin as a percentage of revenues decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to lower total revenues for this business.
Research and Development Expenses
:
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenditures. We intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because, in our judgment, they are essential to maintaining our competitive position.
(1)
Excluding stock-based compensation

Table of Contents
Total research and development expenses increased by $90 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expenses.
General and Administrative Expenses
:
General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel related expenditures for IT, finance, legal and human resources support functions.
(1)
Excluding stock-based compensation
Total general and administrative expenses decreased by $35 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Excluding the favorable effects of currency rate fluctuations of 1%, the decrease was primarily due to a $14 million decrease in facilities and related expenses and a $6 million decrease in professional fees.
Amortization of Intangible Assets
:
Substantially all of our intangible assets were acquired through our business combinations. We amortize our intangible assets over, and monitor the appropriateness of, the estimated useful lives of these assets. We also periodically review these intangible assets for potential impairment based upon relevant facts and circumstances. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for additional information regarding our intangible assets and related amortization.
Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $139 million in reported currency in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to a reduction in expenses associated with certain of our intangible assets that became fully amortized.
Acquisition Related and Other Expenses
:
Acquisition related and other expenses consist of personnel related costs for transitional and certain other employees, certain business combination adjustments, including adjustments after the measurement period has ended, and certain other operating items, net.
Acquisition related and other expenses increased slightly in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, due to a $12 million increase in other expenses primarily related to certain asset impairment charges, partially offset by a $6 million decrease in business combination adjustments, net, and a $4 million decrease in transitional and other employee related costs.

Restructuring Expenses
:
Restructuring expenses resulted from the execution of management-approved restructuring plans that were generally developed to improve our cost structure and/or operations, often in conjunction with our acquisition integration strategies and/or other strategic initiatives. Restructuring expenses consist of employee severance costs, contract termination costs and certain other exit costs to improve our cost structure prospectively. For additional information regarding our restructuring plans, see Note 3 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024.
Restructuring expenses in each of the first quarters of fiscal 2025 and 2024 primarily related to the 2024 Restructuring Plan. Our management approved, committed to and initiated the 2024 Restructuring Plan in order to restructure and further improve efficiencies in our operations. We may incur additional restructuring expenses in future periods due to the initiation of new restructuring plans or from changes in estimated costs associated with existing restructuring plans.
The majority of the initiatives undertaken by the 2024 Restructuring Plan were effected to implement our continued emphasis in developing, marketing, selling and delivering our cloud-based offerings. Certain of the cost savings realized pursuant to the 2024 Restructuring Plan initiatives were offset by investments in resources and geographies that we believe better address the development, marketing, sale and delivery of our cloud-based offerings, including investments in the development and delivery of our second-generation cloud infrastructure.
Interest Expense
:
Interest expense decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to $2.0 billion and $3.5 billion of scheduled repayments of senior notes made during the first quarter of fiscal 2025 and full year of fiscal 2024, respectively.
Non-Operating Income (Expenses), net
:
Non-operating income (expenses), net consists primarily of interest income, net foreign currency exchange losses, the noncontrolling interests in the net profits of our majority-owned subsidiaries (primarily Oracle Financial Services Software Limited and Oracle Corporation Japan), net losses related to equity investments, including losses attributable to equity method investments (primarily Ampere) and net other income and expenses, including net unrealized gains and losses from our investment portfolio related to our deferred compensation plan and non-service net periodic pension income and losses.
33
Table of Contents
Our non-operating income, net increased by $69 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The increase was primarily due to a $32 million decrease in foreign currency losses and a $49 million decrease in losses from equity investments, partially offset by higher expenses for noncontrolling interests in income.
(Provision for) Benefit from Income Taxes
:
Our effective income tax rates for each of the periods presented were the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates. Refer to Note 6 of Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report for a discussion regarding the differences between the effective income tax rates as presented for the periods below and the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates that were in effect during these periods. Future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by an unfavorable shift of earnings weighted to jurisdictions with higher tax rates, by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations, by adverse rulings in tax related litigation, or by shortfalls in stock-based compensation realized by employees relative to stock-based compensation that was recorded for book purposes, among others.
Provision for income taxes increased during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to an unfavorable jurisdictional mix of earnings of $215 million and a decrease in tax benefits of $127 million related to stock-based compensation, partially offset by a $65 million benefit in unrecognized tax benefits associated with settlements with taxing authorities and other events.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
Working capital
:
The increase in working capital as of August 31, 2024 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to favorable impacts to our net current assets resulting from net income during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, substantially offset by $2.3 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, $1.1 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, €750 million of long-term senior notes that were reclassified to current liabilities, $672 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs, $375 million of cash used for purchases of non-marketable investments and $150 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Our working capital may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
:
Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist of deposits held at major banks, money market funds and other securities with original maturities of 90 days or less. Marketable securities consist of time deposits, marketable equity securities and certain other securities with original maturities at the time of purchase greater than 90 days. The increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of August 31, 2024 in comparison to May 31, 2024 was primarily due to cash inflows from our operations during the first quarter of fiscal 2025. This increase was partially offset by $2.4 billion of cash used for repayment of senior notes and commercial paper notes, $2.3 billion of cash used for capital expenditures, $1.1 billion of cash used to pay dividends to our stockholders, $672 million of net cash used for our employee stock programs, $375 million of cash used for purchases of non-marketable investments and $150 million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock. Our cash and cash equivalents may be impacted by some or all of the aforementioned factors in future periods, the amounts and timing of which are variable.

Cash flows from operating activities
:
Our largest source of operating cash flows is cash collections from our customers following the purchase and renewal of their cloud services and license support agreements. Customers for these cloud services and license support agreements are generally billed in advance of services being provided. Over the course of a fiscal year, we also generate cash from the sales of new licenses, hardware offerings and other services. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are typically for employee related expenditures, material and manufacturing costs related to the production of our hardware products, taxes, interest payments and leased facilities.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $453 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable working capital changes, net.
Cash flows from investing activities
:
The changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to our acquisitions, purchases, maturities and sales of our investments in marketable securities and other instruments and investments in capital assets primarily to support the growth in our cloud and license business.
Net cash used for investing activities increased by $1.2 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to the increase in capital expenditures.
Cash flows from financing activities
:
The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and repayments related to our debt instruments, stock repurchases, dividend payments and net proceeds related to employee stock programs.
Net cash used for financing activities increased by $1.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher maturities of senior notes of $1.0 billion, higher repayments of commercial paper notes of $166 million, net of issuances, partially offset by higher net cash used for other activities of $220 million, in each case in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 relative to the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Further, during the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we refinanced our Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined below) that resulted in no net impact on financing cash flows for the period reported.
Free cash flow
:
To supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a GAAP basis, we use non-GAAP measures of cash flows on a trailing 4-quarter basis to analyze cash flows generated from our operations. We believe that free cash flow is also useful as one of the bases for comparing our performance with that of our competitors. The presentation of non-GAAP free cash flow is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our performance, or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. We calculate free cash flow as follows:

Recent Financing Activities

Term Loan Credit Agreements
:
On June 10, 2024, we terminated our term loan credit agreement that we entered into in fiscal 2023 and repaid the principal amount outstanding together with interest accrued up to the date of repayment. Simultaneously, we borrowed up to the maximum commitment amount of $5.6 billion pursuant to a term loan credit agreement (Term Loan Credit Agreement) executed on the same date. Any remaining unpaid principal balance under the Term Loan Credit Agreement will become fully due and payable on August 16, 2027, unless the termination date of Term Loan Credit Agreement is extended. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for additional details about our borrowings.
Contractual Obligations
:
During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, there were no significant changes to our estimates of future payments under our fixed contractual obligations and commitments as presented in Part II, Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, other than an increase in our operating lease commitments to $36.2 billion as of August 31, 2024. Our operating lease commitments, which are primarily for data centers, are generally expected to commence between the remainder of fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2027 and for terms of nine to fifteen years. We have not recorded these lease commitments on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of August 31, 2024. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024 for more information about our lease commitments.
We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances, cash generated from operations, and our borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditures and contractual obligations requirements. In addition, we believe that we could fund our future acquisitions, dividend payments and repurchases of common stock or debt with our internally available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities.
Stock-Based Awards
Our stock-based compensation program is a key component of the compensation package we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders.
We recognize that stock-based awards dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of stock-based awards granted while providing competitive compensation packages. Consistent with these dual goals, our cumulative potential dilution since June 1, 2021 has been an annualized rate of 1.9% per year. The potential dilution percentage is calculated as the average annualized new stock-based awards granted and assumed, net of stock-based awards forfeited by employees leaving the company, divided by the weighted-average outstanding shares during the calculation period. This maximum potential dilution will only result if all stock-based awards vest and, if applicable, are exercised. Of the outstanding stock options as of August 31, 2024, which generally have a ten-year exercise period, all have exercise prices lower than the market price of our common stock on such date. In recent years, our stock repurchase program has substantially offset the dilutive effect of our stock-based compensation program. However, we may modify the levels of our stock repurchases in the future depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash we have available for acquisitions, to pay dividends, to repay or repurchase indebtedness or for other purposes. As of August 31, 2024, the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding stock-based awards, regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested, was 6.1%.

Item 3.	Quantitative and Qualitat
ive Disclosures About Market Risk
There were no significant changes to our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the first quarter of fiscal 2025.

Item 4.	Controls
and Procedures
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures:
Based on our management’s evaluation (with the participation of our Principal Executive and Financial Officer), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, our Principal Executive and Financial Officer has concluded that our “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management (including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer) as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting:
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls:
Our management, including our Principal Executive and Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

Item 2.	Unregistered Sales of Equ
ity Securities and Use of Proceeds
Our Board of Directors has approved a program for us to repurchase shares of our common stock. As of August 31, 2024, approximately $6.8 billion remained available for stock repurchases pursuant to our stock repurchase program.
Our stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of our repurchase activity will depend on factors such as our working capital needs, our cash requirements for acquisitions and dividend payments, our debt repayment obligations or repurchases of our debt, our stock price, and economic and market conditions. Our stock repurchases may be effected from time to time through open market purchases or pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. Our stock repurchase program may be accelerated, suspended, delayed or discontinued at any time.
The following table summarizes the stock repurchase activity for the three months ended August 31, 2024 and the approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased pursuant to our stock repurchase program:
