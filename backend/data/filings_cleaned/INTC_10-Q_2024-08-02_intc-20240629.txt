Total revenue of $12.8 billion was down $116 million from Q2 2023, as CCG revenue increased 9%, DCAI revenue decreased 3%, and NEX revenue decreased 1%. CCG revenue increased primarily due to higher notebook and desktop volumes as customer inventory levels improved compared to higher levels in Q2 2023. DCAI revenue decreased due to lower server volume from lower demand in a competitive environment, partially offset by higher server ASPs primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue was roughly flat. External Intel Foundry revenue decreased due to lower traditional packaging services and equipment sales. Altera
®
revenue decreased as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories.
Key Developments
▪
We achieved a critical milestone on Intel 18A with the release to Intel Foundry customers of Intel 18A PDK 1.0.
▪
We announced the planned implementation of cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, other operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales. These initiatives are designed to accelerate profitable growth, enable further operational efficiency and agility, and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing leadership.
▪
Our Board of Directors declared a Q3 2024 dividend of $0.125 per share on our common stock consistent with prior quarters. We announced our Board of Directors suspended the declaration of dividends on our common stock starting with Q4 2024, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. The Board of Directors reiterated our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.
▪
As part of our SCIP program, we completed a transaction with Apollo Global Management, Inc. (Apollo), under which Apollo led an investment of $11.0 billion to acquire a 49% equity interest in an entity related to our Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland. Fab 34 is our leading-edge high-volume manufacturing (HVM) facility designed for wafers using the Intel 4 and Intel 3 process technologies.

We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2023 Form 10-K.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
We previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to third party customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions.
Our internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera as a standalone business, with segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results. As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.
We organize our business as follows:
▪
Intel Products:
▪
C
lient Computing Group (CCG)
▪
Data
Center and AI (DCAI)
▪
Network
and Edge (NEX)
▪
Intel Foundry
▪
All other
▪
A
ltera
▪
M
obileye
▪
Other
CCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX, Altera, and Mobileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.
The accounting policies for our segment reporting are the same for Intel as a whole. A summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:
Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of revenues from third party customers. The Intel Products operating segments represent a substantial majority of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.
Table of Contents
Intel Foundry
▪
Segment revenue
: consists substantially of intersegment product and services revenue for wafer fabrication and related products and services sold to Intel Products, Altera, and certain other Intel internal businesses. We recognize intersegment revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of Intel Foundry products and services to the Intel Products businesses, which is generally at the completion of wafer sorting and at the completion of assembly and test services. Intersegment sales are recorded at prices that are intended to approximate market pricing. Intel Foundry also includes certain third party foundry and assembly and test revenues from external customers that were $
77
million in the three months ended June 29, 2024 and $
104
million in the first six months of 2024, compared to $
231
million in the three months ended July 1, 2023 and $
349
million in the first six months of 2023.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external customers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing includes excess capacity charges that were previously allocated primarily to CCG, DCAI, and NEX.
All Other: Altera & Mobileye
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of product revenues from third party customers. Altera revenue is derived from programmable semiconductors, primarily FPGAs, CPLDs, acceleration platforms, software, IP, and related products. Mobileye revenue is derived from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.
▪
Segment expenses:
Altera expenses consist of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, third party manufacturing expenses, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Mobileye expenses consists of third party direct expenses for product manufacturing and related services for the manufacturing of Mobileye products and direct operating expenses.
Our "all other" category also consists of "other", which includes:
▪
results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives; and
▪
historical results of operations from divested businesses.
We allocate operating expenses from our sales and marketing group to the Intel Products operating segments, and allocate operating expenses from our finance and administration groups to all of our operating segments, except Mobileye.
We estimate that the substantial majority of our consolidated depreciation expense in the first six months of 2024 and in the first six months of 2023 was incurred by Intel Foundry. Intel Foundry depreciation expense is substantially included in overhead cost pools and then combined with other costs, and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through the manufacturing process and is sold to Intel Products and other customers. As a result, it is impractical to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each Intel Products operating segment's operating income (loss).
We do not allocate to our operating segments corporate operating expenses that primarily consist of:
▪
restructuring and other charges;
▪
share-based compensation;
▪
certain impairment charges; and
▪
certain acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
We do not allocate to our operating segments non-operating items such as:
▪
gains and losses from equity investments;
▪
interest and other income; and
▪
income taxes.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The measures regularly provided to and used by our CODM under our new operating model continue to evolve; currently, our CODM does not regularly review or receive discrete asset information by segment.
Intersegment eliminations:
Intersegment sales and related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third party customers is eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies. Thus certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level. This activity primarily relates to inventory reserves, which are determined and recorded based on our accounting policies for Intel as a whole, but are only recorded by the Intel Products operating segments upon transfer of inventory from Intel Foundry. If a reserve is identified prior to the related inventory transferring to Intel Products, that reserve is presented as activity within the intersegment eliminations.
Table of Contents
Reporting units and goodwill reallocation:
As a result of modifying our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024, we reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization. We concluded based on our pre-reorganization impairment test that goodwill was not impaired. As a result of our post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $
222
million in the first quarter of 2024 related to our Intel Foundry reporting unit as the estimated fair value of the new reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value, which now includes substantially all of our allocated property, plant, and equipment. The Intel Foundry reporting unit has no remaining goodwill. The fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all remaining reporting units tested as part of our post-reorganization impairment test.
Operating segment and consolidated net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:
Table of Contents
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses represent costs incurred that are not directly attributed to an operating segment. The nature of these expenses may vary, but primarily consist of restructuring and other charges, share-based compensation, certain impairment charges, and certain acquisition-related costs.
Semiconductor Co-Investment Program
Ireland SCIP:
In the second quarter of 2024, we closed a transaction with Apollo Global Management, Inc., involving the sale of
49
% of our interest in an Irish limited liability company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of $
11.0
billion, substantially all of which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a VIE that we consolidate into our consolidated financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase
100
% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator. Once Fab 34 construction is complete, we will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP or we will be subject to pay certain penalties to Ireland SCIP.
As of June 29, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Ireland SCIP consisted of cash and cash equivalents. The remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.
Arizona SCIP:
We consolidate the results of an Arizona limited liability company (Arizona SCIP), a VIE, into our consolidated financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from Arizona SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase
100
% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona SCIP at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties.
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona SCIP of $
29.0
billion.
As of June 29, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Arizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our consolidated financial statements. The assets held by Arizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were
$
6.4
billion
as of June 29, 2024 ($
4.8
billion as of December 30, 2023).
Mobileye
In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted
38.5
million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing
5
% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $
42
per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $
1.6
billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $
663
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements.

IMS Nanofabrication
In 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined
32
% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment —including a
20
% stake to Bain Capital and a
10
% stake to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $
1.4
billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $
958
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.
We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.
Due to our net losses in the three and six months ended June 29, 2024 and the six months ended July 1, 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share for these periods and were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share.
Securities that were anti-dilutive were insignificant in all periods presented.
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as
cash provided by operating activities
in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $
1.0
billion during the first six months of 2024 ($
1.0
billion in the first six months of 2023). After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.
Inventories
Other Accrued Liabilities
Other accrued liabilities
include deferred compensation of $
3.0
billion as of June 29, 2024 ($
2.9
billion as of December 30, 2023).
Table of Contents
Interest and Other, Net
Interest expense
is net of $
374
million of interest capitalized in the second quarter of 2024 and $
737
million in the first six months of 2024 ($
381
million in the second quarter of 2023 and $
744
million in the first six months of 2023).
Employee severance and benefit arrangements
includes charges of $
165
million in the three months ended June 29, 2024 and $
294
million in the six months ended June 29, 2024 relating to actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs. We expect these actions to be substantially completed
by the fourth quarter of
2024, but this is subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations.
Litigation charges and other
includes a charge of $
780
million in the second quarter of 2024 arising out of the R2 litigation. Refer to "Note 13: Contingencies" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information on legal proceedings.
Asset impairment charges
includes a goodwill impairment loss of $
222
million in the first
quarter
of 2024 related to our Intel Foundry reporting unit. Refer to "Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information on our business reorganization and goodwill impairment.
In the second quarter of 2024 and YTD 2024,
our benefit from income taxes was determined using the actual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. We also utilized the actual effective tax rate method for the
YTD 2023
period, and had a catch up adjustment to benefit from taxes during the
second
quarter of
2023
to conform to this methodology. We use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period, adjusted for discrete items, if any, under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate. We used this approach in all periods presented due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.

Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within
cash and cash equivalents
and
short-term investments
on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets
.
Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of June 29, 2024 and December 30, 2023,
substantially all
time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in
interest and other, net
. The fair value of our hedged investments was $
17.6
billion as of June 29, 2024 ($
17.1
billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $
139
million in the second quarter of 2024 and net losses of $
366
million in the first six months of 2024 ($
183
million of net losses in the second quarter of 2023 and $

1
Instruments not due at a single maturity date is comprised of money market fund deposits, which are classified as either short-term investments or cash and cash equivalents.
Equity Investments
1
Substantially all of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments. Certain of the trading volume restrictions generally apply for as long as we own more than
1
% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from the rules of the respective exchange.
The components of gains (losses) on equity investments, net for each period were as follows:
1
Sale of equity investments and other includes initial fair value adjustments recorded upon a security becoming marketable, realized gains (losses) on sales of non-marketable equity investments and equity method investments, and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and distributions.

for the transaction's remaining proceeds of $
2.0
billion, which remains outstanding as of June 29, 2024 and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be in March 2025.
In connection with the transaction, we have a wafer manufacturing and sale agreement that includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $
500
million annually, and $
1.5
billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. We recorded a receivable related to these reimbursable costs due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $
144
million within
other current assets
as of June 29, 2024 ($
145
million recorded as of December 30, 2023).
In the second quarter of 2024, we remarketed $
438
million aggregate principal amount of bonds issued by the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona. In accordance with loan agreements we entered into with the Industrial Development Authority of the City of Chandler, Arizona, the bonds are unsecured general obligations. The bonds mature in 2049 and have a
4.00
% coupon. The bonds are subject to optional tender starting in February 2029 and mandatory tender in June 2029, at which time we may remarket the bonds for a new term period.
In the first quarter of 2024, we issued a total of $

Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of $
1.0
billion related to litigation involving VLSI (see VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel below), a charge of $
780
million related to three separate confidential agreements with R2, Third Point, and TRGP we anticipate entering into (see R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation below), and a charge of $
401
million related to an EC-imposed fine (see European Commission Competition Matter below). Excluding the VLSI claims and the R2 matter, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.

European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.
We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.
In April 2022 the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice, which has indicated it will deliver its judgment in October 2024. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
As of July 31, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US and Canada. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions between 2018 and 2021 were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment in November 2023, ending the litigation. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect.
Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purported to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally alleged that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. The district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint and entered judgment in April 2023. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment in April 2024, and plaintiffs did not appeal the Ninth Circuit’s ruling.

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). VLSI sought damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest. Intel prevailed on all eight patents and the court entered final judgment in April 2024. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:
▪
The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.2 billion in damages and approximately $162 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted Inter Partes Reviews (IPR) on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB’s decision. In March 2024, Intel filed a motion to stay the case pending appeals of the IPRs. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents.
▪
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment.
▪
The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents, and the court granted Intel’s motion that same month.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI’s case.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement.
In July 2024, Intel filed suit against VLSI in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware requesting the court find Intel is licensed to VLSI’s patents.
As of June 29, 2024, we have accrued a charge of approximately $1.0 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.

R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation
In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in both actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit.
Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the patent is invalid. Trial in the UK matter took place in April 2024. In July 2024, the UK High Court of Justice found the UK part of R2’s European patent invalid.
In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.
In December 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding R2’s patent valid. A trial in the German Federal Patent Court, followed by a decision on validity is expected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of infringement. In February 2024, the court found Intel’s processors infringe and issued an injunction and recall order against Intel and its customers. R2 has not yet sought to enforce the order. Intel has appealed the decision. In April 2024, Intel also filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court seeking a stay and a reversal of the finding of infringement and filed additional evidence with the appeals court to demonstrate that it does not infringe R2’s patent. In May 2024, the Constitutional Court declined to consider Intel’s complaint.
In March 2024, R2 asserted the same patent against Fujitsu and Amazon Web Services in Dusseldorf Regional Court, accusing Ice Lake and Sapphire Rapids in the AWS suit; and Tiger Lake, Ice Lake, Alder Lake, Raptor Lake, and Sapphire Rapids in the Fujitsu suit. R2 seeks an injunction, recall and damages. Intel is indemnifying and defending its customers. In June 2024, defendants filed a writ setting out their defenses.
In March 2024, Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. filed an action in the Tribunale di Milano  seeking an order that Intel processors do not infringe R2’s patent. In May 2024, R2 filed suit in Milan against Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. and Italian affiliates of customers Dell, HP, and HPE, accusing Intel’s Ice Lake (server and client), Tiger Lake, Alder Lake, and Raptor Lake processors of infringing its patent, and requesting that its suit be consolidated with Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A.’s suit. R2 is requesting an injunction and damages. In June 2024, R2 responded to the suit filed by Intel Corporation Italia S.P.A. and asserted counterclaims of infringement against the same processors R2 accused in its suit.
In April 2024, R2 filed an action against Intel and its customers Dell, HP, and HPE for patent infringement in before the Tribunal Judiciaire of Paris. Intel and its customers have filed a nullity action against the patent in France.
In light of the potential disruption to Intel’s and its customers’ businesses in Europe were the Dusseldorf Regional Court’s injunction and recall order enforced before a decision by the appeals court is expected, the significant delay expected before a decision by the appeals court, and the additional ongoing and potential litigation across other jurisdictions and with respect to other Intel processors and customers, we are in negotiations to enter into three separate confidential agreements with R2, Third Point (the controlling shareholder) and TRGP Capital (a third-party organization funding the lawsuits) to resolve the injunction enforcement risk and related pending litigation, and provide for broad-based litigation peace with these entities, which may include rights to other technology and services to Intel. Based on the anticipated agreements, we recorded a current period charge of $780 million, substantially all of which is attributable to the proposed broad-based litigation peace.

Intel Products
Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Products is comprised of three operating segments: CCG, DCAI, and NEX.
Financial Performance
Total Intel Products revenue was $11.8 billion in Q2 2024 and $11.3 billion in Q2 2023. Revenue increased in Q2 2024 due to our CCG operating segment. Total Intel Products operating income increased to $2.9 billion, or 25% operating margin in Q2 2024 from $2.5 billion, or 22% operating margin in Q2 2023. This Q2 2024 operating margin increase is primarily due to higher Q2 2024 CCG revenue, lower Q2 2024 DCAI and NEX period charges due to the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken, partially offset by higher Q2 2024 unit costs and higher Q2 2024 operating expenses in DCAI.
Total Intel Products revenue was $23.7 billion in YTD 2024 and $21.5 billion in YTD 2023. Revenue increased in YTD 2024 primarily due to our CCG operating segment. Total Intel Products operating income increased to $6.2 billion, or 26% operating margin for YTD 2024 from $3.7 billion, or 17% operating margin in YTD 2023. This YTD 2024 operating margin increase is primarily due to higher YTD 2024 CCG revenue, lower YTD 2024 period charges across each of the Intel Products' operating segments due to the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken, partially offset by higher YTD 2024 unit costs in CCG and DCAI.

Consolidated Revenue
Our Q2 2024 revenue was $12.8 billion, down $116 million from Q2 2023. CCG revenue increased 9% from Q2 2023 primarily due to higher notebook and desktop volumes as customer inventory levels improved compared to higher levels in Q2 2023. Notebook ASPs increased from Q2 2023 primarily driven by the ramp of newly introduced products based upon Intel 4 process technology and a lower mix of small core products, partially offset by an increased mix of older generation products. Desktop ASPs decreased from Q2 2023 primarily driven by a higher mix of older generation products. DCAI revenue decreased 3% from Q2 2023 due to lower server volume from lower demand in a competitive environment, partially offset by increased server ASPs primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue was roughly flat with Q2 2023. External Intel Foundry revenue decreased 67% from Q2 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and equipment sales. Altera revenue decreased 57% from Q2 2023 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories across product lines.
Our Q2 2024 revenue was unfavorably impacted by the revocation of certain licenses for exports of consumer-related items to a customer in China.
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.3 billion to our revenue during Q2 2024. The impacts of these Q2 2024 incentives were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q3 2024, as included in our Form 8-K dated August 1, 2024.
Our YTD 2024 revenue was $25.6 billion, up $893 million or 4% from YTD 2023. CCG revenue increased 19% from YTD 2023 primarily due to higher notebook and desktop volumes as customer inventory levels improved compared to higher levels in YTD 2023. Notebook ASPs increased from YTD 2023 primarily driven by the ramp of newly introduced products based upon Intel 4 process technology and a lower mix of small core products, partially offset by an increased mix of older generation products. Desktop ASPs were roughly flat with YTD 2023. DCAI revenue was roughly flat with YTD 2023 as server ASPs increased primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products, offset primarily by lower server volume from lower demand in a competitive environment. NEX revenue decreased 5% from YTD 2023 primarily due to 5G customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories, partially offset by higher Edge and Network revenue. Altera revenue decreased 58% from YTD 2023 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and Mobileye revenue decreased 26% from YTD 2023 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories across EyeQ products. External Intel Foundry revenue decreased 70% from YTD 2023 due to lower equipment sales and traditional packaging services.

Operating Expenses
Total R&D and MG&A expenses for Q2 2024 were $5.6 billion, up 2% from Q2 2023, and $11.5 billion for YTD 2024, up 6% from YTD 2023. These expenses represent 43.4% of revenue for Q2 2024 and 42.1% of revenue for Q2 2023, and 45.0% of revenue for YTD 2024 and 44.1% of revenue for YTD 2023. In support of our strategy, described in our 2023 Form 10-K, we continue to make significant investments to accelerate our process technology roadmap. This requires continued investments in R&D and focused efforts to attract and retain talent. We expect total R&D and MG&A expenses to be reduced as we implement planned cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount and other operating expenditures, designed to accelerate profitable growth, enable further operational efficiency and agility, and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing leadership.

Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, Net
I
n Q2 2024, impairments and ongoing mark-to-market losses for our interest in Montage Technology Co., were partially offset by ongoing mark-to-market gains for other marketable equity securities. For YTD 2024, we recognized a $336 million initial fair value adjustment within
sale of equity investments and other
upon Astera Labs, Inc. shares becoming marketable, which was partially offset by impairments and ongoing mark-to-market losses for our interest in Montage Technology Co.
YTD 2023 gains were primarily driven by our interest in Montage Technology Co., Ltd and others.
Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes
In Q2 2024, we recognized a benefit from taxes as we applied our year-to-date actual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income (loss) before taxes, which reflects our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses. Benefit from taxes in
Q2 2023
represented the year-to-date true-up adjustment when the actual effective tax rate approach was adopted starting in the second quarter of
2023
. Our effective tax rate decreased in
YTD 2024
compared to
YTD 2023
, primarily driven by a higher proportion of our income being taxed in non-US jurisdictions, and our R&D tax credits which provide a tax benefit based on our eligible R&D spending and are not dependent on income before taxes.
Our benefit from income taxes was determined using the actual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, for all periods presented due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions. We use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period, adjusted for discrete items, if any, under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken, including our Ireland SCIP transaction that closed in the second quarter of 2024 that resulted in $11.0 billion of net cash inflows to us. Refer to "Note 3: Non-Controlling Interests" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; potential acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. We expect reductions in operating expenditures, capital expenditures, and cost of sales as we implement cost-reduction measures, including reductions in headcount, designed to accelerate profitable growth, enable further operational efficiency and agility, and create capacity for sustained investment in technology and manufacturing leadership. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our total cash and short-term investments
and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments.
In July 2024 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on September 1, 2024, to stockholders of record as of August 7, 2024. On August 1, 2024, we announced our Board of Directors suspended the declaration of quarterly dividends on our common stock starting with Q4 2024, recognizing the importance of prioritizing liquidity to support the investments needed to execute our strategy. The Board of Directors reiterated our long-term commitment to a competitive dividend as cash flows improve to sustainably higher levels.
In the first half of 2024, we issued a total of
$2.6 billion
aggregate principal amount of senior notes and remarketed $438 million aggregate principal amount of other bonds for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures.
We also
expanded both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of June 29, 2024, we had $3.2 billion of commercial paper obligations outstanding and no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities. Refer to "Note 10: Borrowings" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in investment-grade securities.
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities were as follows:
Table of Contents
Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income (loss) adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
Cash provided by operations in the first six months of 2024 was roughly flat compared to the first six months of 2023 as we incurred a higher net loss that was offset by more favorable operating cash flow adjustments in the first six months of 2024 relative to the first six months of 2023.
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from capital-related government incentives.
Cash used for investing activities was higher in the first six months of 2024 compared to the first six months of 2023, primarily due to a reduction in cash flows from the sales and maturities of short-term investments, net of purchases, and certain other cash unfavorable investing activities during the first six months of 2024. These cash unfavorable movements in the first six months of 2024 were partially offset by lower capital additions and greater proceeds from capital related incentives during the first six months of 2024 relative to the first six months of 2023.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and payment of dividends to stockholders.
Cash provided by financing activities was higher in the first six months of 2024 compared to the first six months of 2023, primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions and reduced dividend payments. These activities were partially offset by a reduction in proceeds from our debt and commercial paper issuances, net of debt and commercial paper repayments; and the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares in the first six months of 2024 compared to proceeds in the first six months of 2023.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on at least an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Following are the reconciliations of our most comparable US GAAP measures to our non-GAAP measures presented:

Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Form 8-K Disclosable Events
On July 30, 2024, our Board of Directors approved the adoption of the Intel Corporation Executive Severance Plan, effective as of August 1, 2024. The plan provides that certain senior executives, including the company’s named executive officers other than its CEO, are eligible to receive severance payments and benefits in the event of a termination of employment by the company without cause (as defined in the plan). Subject to the execution and non-revocation of a release of claims in favor of the company, such named executive officers are eligible to receive the following severance payments and benefits:
•
a
cash payment equal to 1.5 times the sum of base salary and target annual bonus opportunity, payable in installments over an 18-month period following termination of employment in accordance with the company’s payroll practices;
•
an additional lump sum payment approximately equal to 18 months of the monthly premium for participation in the company’s group health plans;
•
pro-rated v
esting of eligible restricted stock units and eligible performance stock units based on the number of whole months of employment during the vesting period; provided that the vesting of time-based equity awards will accelerate at the time of termination of employment and performance-based equity awards will vest based on actual performance results at the end of the applicable performance period; and
•
o
utplacement services at the company’s expense for up to 18 months
.
The foregoing summary of the plan does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the plan, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.3 hereto.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Table of Contents
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended June 29, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending June 29, 2024. As of June 29, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended June 29, 2024, no such plans or arrangements were
adopted
or
terminated
, including by modification.
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
