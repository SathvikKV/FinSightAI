Description of business, including segment and geographic area information
We design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have
two
reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.
•
Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of
two
major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.
•
Embedded Processing products are the digital “brains” of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.
We report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP
®
products, calculators and custom ASIC products.
Our centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments’ results and, therefore, is not provided.

Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices
Basis of presentation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) and on the same basis as the audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income and Cash Flows for the periods ended June 30, 2024 and 2023, and the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2024, are not audited but reflect all adjustments that are of a normal recurring nature and are necessary for a fair statement of the results of the periods shown. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual consolidated financial statements have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Because the consolidated interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for a complete set of financial statements, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. The results for the three- and six-month periods are not necessarily indicative of a full year’s results.
Significant accounting policies and practices
Earnings per share (EPS)
We use the two-class method for calculating EPS because the restricted stock units (RSUs) we grant are participating securities containing nonforfeitable rights to receive dividend equivalents. Under the two-class method, a portion of net income is allocated to RSUs and excluded from the calculation of income allocated to common stock.
7
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows:
Potentially dilutive securities representing
8
million and
9
million shares of common stock that were outstanding during the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and
11
million and
9
million shares outstanding during the first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per common share during these periods because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Derivatives and hedging
We use derivative financial instruments to manage exposure to foreign exchange risk. These instruments are primarily forward foreign currency exchange contracts, which are used as economic hedges to reduce the earnings impact that exchange rate fluctuations may have on our non-U.S. dollar net balance sheet exposures. Gains and losses from changes in the fair value of these forward foreign currency exchange contracts are credited or charged to OI&E. We do not apply hedge accounting to our foreign currency derivative instruments.
We are exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. We use total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense, recognizing changes in the value of the swaps and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A.
In connection with the issuance of long-term debt, we may use financial derivatives such as treasury-rate lock agreements that are recognized in AOCI and amortized over the life of the related debt.
The results of these derivative transactions were not material. We do not use derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
8
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
Fair values of financial instruments
The fair values of our derivative financial instruments were not material as of June 30, 2024. Our investments in cash equivalents, short-term investments and certain long-term investments, as well as our deferred compensation liabilities, are carried at fair value. The carrying values for other current financial assets and liabilities, such as accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.
As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of long-term debt, including the current portion, was $
13.89
billion, and the estimated fair value was $
12.78
billion. The estimated fair value is measured using broker-dealer quotes, which are Level 2 inputs. See Note 4 for a description of fair value and the definition of Level 2 inputs.
3.
Income taxes
Provision for income taxes is based on the following:
The effective tax rate differs from the
21
% U.S. statutory corporate tax rate due to the effect of U.S. tax benefits.
4.
Valuation of debt and equity investments and certain liabilities
Investments measured at fair value
Money market funds, debt investments and mutual funds are stated at fair value, which is generally based on market prices or broker quotes. We classify all debt investments as available-for-sale. See
Fair-value considerations
. Unrealized gains and losses are recorded as an increase or decrease, net of taxes, in AOCI on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and any credit losses are recorded as an allowance for credit losses with an offset recognized in OI&E in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
Our mutual funds hold a variety of debt and equity investments intended to generate returns that offset changes in certain deferred compensation liabilities. We record changes in the fair value of these mutual funds and the related deferred compensation liabilities in SG&A.
Other investments
Our other investments include equity-method investments and nonmarketable investments, which are not measured at fair value. These investments consist of interests in venture capital funds and other nonmarketable securities. Gains and losses from equity-method investments are recognized in OI&E based on our ownership share of the investee’s financial results. Nonmarketable securities are measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments. Gains and losses on nonmarketable investments are recognized in OI&E.
9
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
Details of our investments are as follows:
As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, unrealized gains and losses associated with our debt investments were not material. We did
no
t recognize any credit losses related to debt investments for the first six months of 2024 and 2023.
The following table presents the aggregate maturities of our available-for-sale debt investments as of June 30, 2024:
Proceeds from sales, redemptions and maturities of short-term available-for-sale investments were $
3.13
billion and $
3.07
billion for the second quarters of 2024 and 2023, respectively, and $
5.76
billion and $
7.09
billion for the first six months of 2024 and 2023, respectively. Gross realized gains and losses from these sales were not material.
Fair-value considerations
We measure and report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.
The three-level hierarchy described below indicates the extent and level of judgment used to estimate fair-value measurements.
•
Level 1
– Uses unadjusted quoted prices that are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.
10
TEXAS INSTRUMENTS INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES
•
Level 2
– Uses inputs other than Level 1 that are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date through correlation with market data, including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active. Level 2 also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models, such as interest rates and volatility factors, are corroborated by readily observable data. We utilize a third-party data service to provide Level 2 valuations. We verify these valuations for reasonableness relative to unadjusted quotes obtained from brokers or dealers based on observable prices for similar assets in active markets.
•
Level 3
– Uses inputs that are unobservable, supported by little or no market activity and reflect the use of significant management judgment. These values are generally determined using pricing models that utilize management estimates of market participant assumptions. As of June 30, 2024, and December 31, 2023, we had
no
Level 3 assets or liabilities.
The following are our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis. These tables do not include cash on hand, assets held by our postretirement plans, or assets and liabilities that are measured at historical cost or any basis other than fair value.

Debt and lines of credit
Short-term borrowings
We maintain a line of credit to provide additional liquidity through bank loans and, if necessary, to support commercial paper borrowings. As of June 30, 2024, the aforementioned line of credit was a variable-rate, revolving credit facility from a consortium of investment-grade banks that allows us to borrow up to $
1
billion until March 2025. The interest rate on borrowings under this credit facility, if drawn, is indexed to the applicable Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (Term SOFR). As of June 30, 2024, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had
no
commercial paper outstanding.
Long-term debt
In May 2024, we retired $
300
million of maturing debt.
In February 2024, we issued
five
series of senior unsecured notes for an aggregate principal amount of $
3.00
billion, consisting of:
•
$
650
million of
4.60
% notes due in 2027;
•
$
650
million of
4.60

million of
5.15
% notes due in 2054; and
•
$
350
million further issuance of existing
5.05
% notes due in 2063.
We incurred $
16

Contingencies
Indemnification guarantees
We routinely sell products with an intellectual property indemnification included in the terms of sale. Historically, we have had only minimal, infrequent losses associated with these indemnities. Consequently, we cannot reasonably estimate any future liabilities that may result.
Warranty costs/product liabilities
Our stated warranties for semiconductor products obligate us to repair, replace or credit the purchase price of a covered product back to the buyer. Product claim consideration may exceed the price of our products. Historically, we have experienced a low rate of payments on product claims. Although we cannot predict the likelihood or amount of any future claims, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We accrue for known product-related claims if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. During the periods presented, there have been no material accruals or payments regarding product warranty or product liability.
General
We are subject to various legal and administrative proceedings. Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of these matters, we believe that the results of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 2. Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
Overview
We design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. Technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric for owners to measure our progress is through the growth of free cash flow per share over the long term.
Our strategy to maximize long-term free cash flow per share growth has three elements:
1.
A great business model that is focused on analog and embedded processing products and built around four sustainable competitive advantages. The four sustainable competitive advantages are powerful in combination and provide tangible benefits:
i.
A strong foundation of manufacturing and technology that provides lower costs and greater control of our supply chain.
ii.
A broad portfolio of analog and embedded processing products that offers more opportunity per customer and more value for our investments.
iii.
The reach of our market channels that gives access to more customers and more of their design projects, leading to the opportunity to sell more of our products into each design and gives us better insight and knowledge of customer needs.
iv.
Diversity and longevity of our products, markets and customer positions that provide less single point dependency and longer returns on our investments.
Together, these competitive advantages help position TI in a unique class of companies capable of generating and returning significant amounts of cash for our owners. We make our investments with an eye towards long-term strengthening and leveraging of these advantages.
2.
Discipline in allocating capital to the best opportunities. This spans how we select R&D projects, develop new capabilities like TI.com, invest in new manufacturing capacity or how we think about acquisitions and returning cash to our owners.
3.
Efficiency, which means constantly striving for more output for every dollar spent.
We believe that our business model with the combined effect of our four competitive advantages sets TI apart from our peers and will for a long time to come. We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document. In the following discussion of our results of operations:
•
Our segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels, and how management allocates resources and measures results. See Note 1 to the financial statements for more information regarding our segments.
•
When we discuss our results:
◦
Unless otherwise noted, changes in our revenue are attributable to changes in customer demand, which are evidenced by fluctuations in shipment volumes.
◦
New products do not tend to have a significant impact on our revenue in any given period because we sell such a large number of products.
◦
From time to time, our revenue and gross profit are affected by changes in demand for higher-priced or lower-priced products, which we refer to as changes in the “mix” of products shipped.
17
◦
Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.

For an explanation of free cash flow, see the Non-GAAP financial information section.

All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.
Performance summary
Our second quarter revenue was $3.82 billion, net income was $1.13 billion and earnings per share (EPS) were $1.22.
Revenue decreased 16% from the same quarter a year ago and increased 4% sequentially. Industrial and automotive continued to decline sequentially, while all other end markets grew.
Our cash flow from operations of $6.4 billion for the trailing 12 months again underscored the strength of our business model, the quality of our product portfolio and the benefit of 300mm production. Free cash flow for the same period was $1.5 billion.
Over the past 12 months we invested $3.7 billion in R&D and SG&A, invested $5.0 billion in capital expenditures and returned $4.9 billion to shareholders.
Results of operations – second quarter 2024 compared with second quarter 2023
Revenue of $3.82 billion decreased $709 million, or 16%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $2.21 billion was down $699 million, or 24%, primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing unit costs associated with our planned capacity expansions and reduced factory loadings. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 57.8% from 64.2%. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit costs due to increased factory loadings and more manufacturing internally, with more wafers on 300mm.
Operating expenses (R&D and SG&A) were $963 million compared with $938 million.
Operating profit was $1.25 billion, or 32.7% of revenue, compared with $1.97 billion, or 43.5% of revenue.
OI&E was $130 million of income compared with $119 million of income, primarily due to higher interest income.
Interest and debt expense of $131 million increased $42 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt. See Note 6 to the financial statements.
Our provision for income taxes was $120 million compared with $280 million. This decrease was due to lower income before income taxes and higher discrete tax benefits.
Net income was $1.13 billion compared with $1.72 billion. EPS was $1.22 compared with $1.87.
18
Second quarter 2024 segment results
Our segment results compared with the year-ago quarter are as follows:
Analog (includes Power and Signal Chain product lines)
Analog revenue decreased due to the mix of products shipped in both product lines, led by Signal Chain. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs.
Embedded Processing (includes microcontrollers and processors)
Embedded Processing revenue decreased. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit.
Other (includes DLP
®
products, calculators and custom ASIC products)
Other revenue decreased $80 million, and operating profit decreased $70 million.
Results of operations – first six months of 2024 compared with first six months of 2023
Revenue of $7.48 billion decreased $1.43 billion, or 16%, primarily due to lower revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.
Gross profit of $4.31 billion was down $1.47 billion, or 25%, primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing unit costs associated with reduced factory loadings and our planned capacity expansions. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit decreased to 57.5% from 64.8%.
Operating expenses were $1.90 billion compared with $1.87 billion.
Restructuring charges/other was a credit of $124 million primarily due to a gain on the sale of a property during 2024.
Operating profit was $2.53 billion, or 33.9% of revenue, compared with $3.91 billion, or 43.8% of revenue.
OI&E was $253 million of income compared with $199 million of income, primarily due to higher interest income.
Interest and debt expense of $247 million increased $90 million due to the issuance of additional long-term debt.
Our provision for income taxes was $308 million compared with $518 million. This decrease was due to lower income before income taxes.
19
Net income was $2.23 billion compared with $3.43 billion. EPS was $2.42 compared with $3.72.
Year-to-date segment results
Our segment results compared with the year-ago period are as follows:
Analog
Analog revenue decreased due to the mix of products shipped in both product lines, led by Signal Chain. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and higher manufacturing costs.
Embedded Processing
Embedded Processing revenue decreased. Operating profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and associated gross profit.
Other
Other revenue decreased $165 million, and operating profit decreased $20 million.
Financial condition
At the end of the second quarter of 2024, total cash (cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments) was $9.69 billion, an increase of $1.11 billion from the end of 2023.
Accounts receivable were $1.71 billion, a decrease of $76 million compared with the end of 2023. Days sales outstanding for the second quarter of 2024 were 40 compared with 39 at the end of 2023.
Inventory was $4.11 billion, an increase of $107 million from the end of 2023. Days of inventory for the second quarter of 2024 were 229 compared with 219 at the end of 2023.
Liquidity and capital resources
Our primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations. Additional sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and access to debt markets. We also have a variable-rate, revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2024, our credit facility was undrawn, and we had no commercial paper outstanding. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2024 were $2.59 billion, an increase of $29 million from the year-ago period primarily due to lower cash used for working capital, partially offset by lower net income. Cash flows from operating activities for the first six months of 2024 include a cash benefit of $312 million from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act investment tax credit used to reduce income taxes payable.
20
Investing activities for the first six months of 2024 used $3.33 billion compared with $2.36 billion in the year-ago period. Capital expenditures were $2.31 billion compared with $2.43 billion in the year-ago period and were primarily for semiconductor manufacturing equipment and facilities in both periods. Short-term investments used cash of $1.20 billion compared with $31 million of cash provided in the year-ago period.
As we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology as part of our long-term capacity planning, our capital expenditures are expected to remain at elevated levels. In August 2022, the U.S. government enacted the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provides funding for manufacturing grants and research investments and establishes a 25% investment tax credit for certain investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. We began receiving the cash benefit associated with the investment tax credit for qualifying capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024. See Note 9 to the financial statements. We have also submitted applications for the manufacturing grants provided by the legislation.
Financing activities for the first six months of 2024 provided $517 million compared with $187 million in the year-ago period. In 2024, we received net proceeds of $2.98 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $300 million. In the year-ago period, we received net proceeds of $3.00 billion from the issuance of fixed-rate, long-term debt and retired maturing debt of $500 million. Dividends paid were $2.37 billion compared with $2.25 billion in the year-ago period, reflecting an increased dividend rate. We used $74 million to repurchase 0.4 million shares of our common stock compared with $182 million in the year-ago period to repurchase 1.1 million shares. Employee exercises of stock options provided cash proceeds of $313 million compared with $150 million in the year-ago period.
We had $2.74 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $6.95 billion of short-term investments as of June 30, 2024. We believe we have the necessary financial resources and operating plans to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividend and debt-related payments, and other business requirements for at least the next 12 months.
Non-GAAP financial information
This MD&A includes references to free cash flow and ratios based on that measure. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). Free cash flow was calculated by subtracting capital expenditures from the most directly comparable GAAP measure, cash flows from operating activities (also referred to as cash flow from operations).
We believe that free cash flow and the associated ratios provide insight into our liquidity, our cash-generating capability and the amount of cash potentially available to return to shareholders, as well as insight into our financial performance. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures.
Reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is provided in the table below.
* Includes a cash benefit of $312 million from the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act ITC used to reduce income taxes payable for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024
