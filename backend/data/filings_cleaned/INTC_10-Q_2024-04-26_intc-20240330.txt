Organization of Our Form 10-Q
The order and presentation of content in our Form 10-Q differs from the traditional SEC Form 10-Q format. Our format is designed to improve readability and better present how we organize and manage our business. See "Form 10-Q Cross-Reference Index" within Risk Factors and Other Key Information for a cross-reference index to the traditional SEC Form 10-Q format.
We have defined certain terms and abbreviations used throughout our Form 10-Q in "Key Terms" within the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details.
The preparation of our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements is in conformity with US GAAP. Our Form 10-Q includes key metrics that we use to measure our business, some of which are non-GAAP measures. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" within MD&A for an explanation of these measures and why management uses them and believes they provide investors with useful supplemental information.

Total revenue of $12.7 billion was up $1.0 billion or 9% from Q1 2023, as CCG revenue increased 31%, DCAI revenue increased 5%, and NEX revenue decreased 8%. CCG revenue increased primarily due to higher notebook and desktop volumes as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in Q1 2023. DCAI revenue increased due to higher server ASPs primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products, partially offset by lower server volume due to lower demand in a competitive environment and a higher mix of high core count products. NEX revenue decreased primarily due to 5G customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories, partially offset by higher Edge and Network revenue. Altera, an Intel Company (previously Intel's Programmable Solutions Group) and Mobileye revenue decreased as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories.

We prepared our interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements that accompany these notes in conformity with US GAAP, consistent in all material respects with those applied in our 2023 Form 10-K.
We have made estimates and judgments affecting the amounts reported in our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the accompanying notes. The actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates. The interim financial information is unaudited, and reflects all normal adjustments that are, in our opinion, necessary to provide a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented. This report should be read in conjunction with our 2023 Form 10-K where we include additional information on our critical accounting estimates, policies, and the methods and assumptions used in our estimates.
We previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCAI, and NEX) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to third party customers. Both businesses utilize marketing, sales, and other support functions.
Our internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate Altera, an Intel Company (previously Intel's Programmable Solutions Group), as a standalone business, with segment reporting beginning in the first quarter of 2024. Altera was previously included in our DCAI segment results. As a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. All prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) internally receives information and manages and monitors our operating segment performance starting in fiscal year 2024. There are no changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods.
We organize our business as follows:
▪
Intel Products:
▪
C
lient Computing Group (CCG)
▪
Data
Center and AI (DCAI)
▪
Network
and Edge (NEX)
▪
Intel Foundry
▪
All other
▪
A
ltera
▪
M
obileye
▪
Other
CCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX, Altera, and Mobileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.
The accounting policies for our segment reporting are the same for Intel as a whole. A summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:
Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of revenues from third party customers. The Intel Products operating segments represent a substantial majority of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.
Table of Contents
Intel Foundry
▪
Segment revenue
: consists substantially of intersegment product and services revenue for wafer fabrication and related products and services sold to Intel Products, Altera, and certain other Intel internal businesses. We recognize intersegment revenue when we satisfy performance obligations as evidenced by the transfer of control of Intel Foundry products and services to the Intel Products businesses, which is generally at the completion of wafer sorting and at the completion of assembly and test services. Intersegment sales are recorded at prices that are intended to approximate market pricing. Intel Foundry also includes certain third party foundry and assembly and test revenues from external customers that were $
27
million in first three months of 2024 and $
118
million in the first three months of 2023.
▪
Segment expenses:
consists of direct expenses for technology development, product manufacturing and services provided by Intel Foundry to internal and external customers, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Direct expenses for product manufacturing includes excess capacity charges that were previously allocated primarily to CCG, DCAI, and NEX.
All other: Altera & Mobileye
▪
Segment revenue:
consists of product revenues from third party customers. Altera revenue is derived from programmable semiconductors, primarily FPGAs, CPLDs, acceleration platforms, software, IP, and related products. Mobileye revenue is derived from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.
▪
Segment expenses:
Altera expenses consist of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, third party manufacturing, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses. Mobileye expenses consists of third party direct expenses for product manufacturing and related services for the manufacturing of Mobileye products and direct operating expenses.
Our "all other" category also consists of "other", which includes:
▪
results of operations from non-reportable segments not otherwise presented, and from start-up businesses that support our initiatives; and
▪
historical results of operations from divested businesses.
We allocate operating expenses from our sales and marketing group to the Intel Products operating segments, and allocate operating expenses from our finance and administration groups to all of our operating segments, except Mobileye. Previously, operating expense from all of these groups as well as manufacturing and engineering, were generally allocated to all the operating segments, except Mobileye.
We estimate that the substantial majority of our consolidated depreciation expense was incurred by Intel Foundry in the first three months of 2024 and in the first three months of 2023. Intel Foundry depreciation expense is substantially included in overhead cost pools and then combined with other costs, and subsequently absorbed into inventory as each product passes through the manufacturing process and is sold to Intel Products and other customers. As a result, it is impractical to determine the total depreciation expense included as a component of each Intel Products operating segment's operating income (loss) results.
We do not allocate to our operating segments corporate operating expenses that primarily consist of:
▪
restructuring and other charges;
▪
share-based compensation;
▪
certain impairment charges; and
▪
certain acquisition-related costs, including amortization and any impairment of acquisition-related intangibles and goodwill.
We do not allocate to our operating segments non-operating items such as:
▪
gains and losses from equity investments;
▪
interest and other income; and
▪
income taxes.
The CODM, who is our CEO, allocates resources to and assesses the performance of each operating segment using information about the operating segment's revenue and operating income (loss). Although the CODM uses operating income (loss) to evaluate the segments, operating costs included in one segment may benefit other segments. The measures regularly provided to and used by our CODM under our new operating model continue to evolve; currently, our CODM does not regularly review or receive discrete asset information by segment.
Intersegment eliminations:
Intersegment sales and related gross margin on inventory recorded at the end of the period or sold through to third party customers is eliminated for consolidation purposes. The Intel Products operating segments and Intel Foundry are meant to reflect separate fabless semiconductor and foundry companies. Thus certain intersegment activity is captured within the intersegment eliminations upon consolidation and presented at the Intel consolidated level. This activity primarily relates to inventory reserves which are determined and recorded based on our accounting policies for Intel as a whole, but are only recorded by the Intel Products operating segments upon transfer of inventory from Intel Foundry. If a reserve is identified prior to the related inventory transferring to Intel Products, that reserve is presented as activity within the intersegment eliminations.
Table of Contents
Reporting units and goodwill reallocation:
As a result of modifying our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024, we reallocated goodwill among our affected reporting units on a relative fair value basis. We performed a quantitative goodwill impairment assessment for each of our reporting units immediately before and after our business reorganization. We concluded based on our pre-reorganization impairment test that goodwill was not impaired. As a result of our post-reorganization impairment test, we recognized a non-cash goodwill impairment loss of $
222
million in the first three months of 2024 related to our new Intel Foundry reporting unit as the estimated fair value of the new reporting unit was lower than the assigned carrying value, which now includes substantially all of our allocated property, plant, and equipment. The Intel Foundry reporting unit has no remaining goodwill. The fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all remaining reporting units tested as part of our post-reorganization impairment test.
Operating segment and consolidated net revenue and operating income (loss) for each period were as follows:
Table of Contents
Corporate Unallocated Expenses
Corporate unallocated expenses represent costs incurred that are not directly attributed to an operating segment. The nature of these expenses may vary, but primarily consist of restructuring and other charges, share-based compensation, certain impairment charges, and certain acquisition-related costs.
Semiconductor Co-Investment Program
In 2022, we closed a transaction with Brookfield Asset Management (Brookfield) resulting in the formation of Arizona Fab LLC (Arizona Fab). We consolidate the results of Arizona Fab, a VIE, into our consolidated financial statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from Arizona Fab based on both parties' proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by Arizona Fab, and we will have the right to purchase
100
% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to operate Arizona Fab at minimum production levels measured in wafer starts per week and will be required to limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain penalties.
We have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of Arizona Fab of $
29.0
billion.
As of March 30, 2024, substantially all of the assets of Arizona Fab consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The assets held by Arizona Fab, which can be used only to settle obligations of the VIE and are not available to us, were
$
5.6
billion
as of March 30, 2024 ($
4.8
billion as of December 30, 2023).
Mobileye
In 2022, Mobileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted
38.5
million of our Mobileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing
5
% of Mobileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A shares for $
42
per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $
1.6
billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $
663
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of Mobileye into our consolidated financial statements.
IMS Nanofabrication
In 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined
32
% minority stake in our IMS business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment —including a
20
% stake to Bain Capital and a
10
% stake to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $
1.4
billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $
958
million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IMS into our consolidated financial statements.
Table of Contents
We computed basic earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. We computed diluted earnings (loss) per share of common stock based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Potentially dilutive shares of common stock from employee equity incentive plans are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan.
Due to our net losses in the three months ended March 30, 2024 and April 1, 2023, the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding RSUs, and the assumed issuance of common stock under the stock purchase plan had an anti-dilutive effect on diluted loss per share for the period and were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share.
Accounts Receivable
We sell certain of our accounts receivable on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions. We record these transactions as sales of receivables and present cash proceeds as
cash provided by operating activities
in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows. Accounts receivable sold under non-recourse factoring arrangements were $
500
million during the first three months of 2024 ($
500
million in the first three months of 2023). After the sale of our accounts receivable, we expect to collect payment from the customers and remit it to the third-party financial institution.
Inventories
Other Accrued Liabilities
Other accrued liabilities
include deferred compensation of $
2.9
billion as of March 30, 2024 ($
2.9
billion as of December 30, 2023).
Interest and Other, Net
Interest expense
is net of $
363
million of interest capitalized in the first three months of 2024 ($
363
million in the first three months of 2023).
Table of Contents
Employee severance and benefit arrangements
includes a charge of $
129
million in the first
quarter
of 2024 relating to actions taken to streamline operations and to reduce costs. We expect these actions to be
substantially completed by the third quarter of
2024, but this is subject to change. Any changes to the estimates or timing will be reflected in our results of operations.
Asset impairment charges
includes a goodwill impairment loss of $
222
million in the first
quarter
of 2024 related to our new Intel Foundry reporting unit. Refer to "Note 2: Operating Segments" within Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further information on our business reorganization and goodwill impairment.
Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim
period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. During the
first
quarter
of 2024, we used
the actual effective tax rate
approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.
Short-term Investments
Short-term investments include marketable debt investments in corporate debt, government debt, and financial institution instruments, and are recorded within
cash and cash equivalents
and
short-term investments
on the
Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheets
.
Government debt includes instruments such as non-US government bills and bonds and US agency securities. Financial institution instruments include instruments issued or managed by financial institutions in various forms, such as commercial paper, fixed- and floating-rate bonds, money market fund deposits, and time deposits. As of March 30, 2024, and December 30, 2023,
substantially all
time deposits were issued by institutions outside the US.
For certain of our marketable debt investments, we economically hedge market risks at inception with a related derivative instrument or the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. These hedged investments are reported at fair value with gains or losses from the investments and the related derivative instruments recorded in
interest and other, net
. The fair value of our hedged investments was $
13.8
billion as of March 30, 2024 ($
17.1
billion as of December 30, 2023). For hedged investments still held at the reporting date, we recorded net losses of $
307
million in the first three months of 2024 ($
90
million of net gains in the first three months of 2023). We recorded net gains on the related derivatives of $
345
million in the first three months of 2024 ($
102
million of net losses in the first three months of 2023).
Our remaining unhedged marketable debt investments are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax, recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)
and realized gains or losses recorded in
interest and other, net
. The adjusted cost of our unhedged investments was $
4.0
billion as of March 30, 2024 ($
4.7
billion as of December 30, 2023), which approximated the fair value for these periods.
Table of Contents
The fair value of marketable debt investments, by contractual maturity, as of March 30, 2024, was as follows:
1
Instruments not due at a single maturity date is comprised of money market fund deposits, which are classified as either short-term investments or cash and cash equivalents.
Equity Investments
1
Approximately
90
% of our marketable equity securities are subject to trading-volume or market-based restrictions, which limit the number of shares we may sell in a specified period of time, impacting our ability to liquidate these investments. Certain of the trading volume restrictions generally apply for as long as we own more than
1
% of the outstanding shares. Market-based restrictions result from the rules of the respective exchange.
The components of
gains (losses) on equity investments, net
for each period were as follows:
1
Sale of equity investments and other includes initial fair value adjustments recorded upon a security becoming marketable, realized gains (losses) on sales of non-marketable equity investments and equity method investments, and our share of equity method investee gains (losses) and distributions.
NAND Memory Business
The NAND memory business included our
NAND memory technology and manufacturing business (the NAND OpCo Business), which we deconsolidated upon closing the first phase of our sale agreement with SK hynix Inc (SK hynix) on December 29, 2021. We have a receivable within
other current assets
for the remaining proceeds of $
2.0
billion, which remains outstanding as of March 30, 2024 and will be received upon the second closing of the transaction, expected to be in March 2025.
The wafer manufacturing and sale agreement includes incentives and penalties that are contingent on the cost of operation and output of the NAND OpCo Business. These incentives and penalties present a maximum exposure of up to $
500
million annually, and $
1.5
billion in the aggregate. We are currently in negotiations with SK hynix to update the operating plan of the NAND OpCo Business, which may impact the metrics associated with the incentives and penalties and our expectations of the performance of the NAND OpCo Business against those metrics.
We were reimbursed for costs that we incurred on behalf of the NAND OpCo Business for corporate function services, which include human resources, information technology, finance, supply chain, and other compliance requirements. We recorded a receivable related to these reimbursable costs due from the NAND OpCo Business, a deconsolidated entity, of $
150
million within
other current assets
as of March 30, 2024 ($
145
million recorded as of December 30, 2023).
Table of Contents
In the first quarter of 2024, we issued a total of $
2.6
billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes. We also
expanded both our
5-year
$
5.0
billion revolving credit facility agreement and our
364-day
$
5.0
billion credit facility agreement, to $
7.0
billion and $
8.0
billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended by one year to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. The revolving credit facilities had
no
borrowings outstanding as of March 30, 2024.
We have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $
10.0
billion under our commercial paper program.
We
had $
793
million of commercial paper outstanding as of March 30, 2024 (
no
commercial paper outstanding as of December 30, 2023).
Our senior fixed rate notes pay interest semiannually. We may redeem the fixed rate notes prior to their maturity at our option at specified redemption prices and subject to certain restrictions. The obligations under our senior fixed rate notes rank equally in the right of payment with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and effectively rank junior to all liabilities of our subsidiaries.

Legal Proceedings
We are regularly party to various ongoing claims, litigation, and other proceedings, including those noted in this section. We have accrued a charge of $
1.0
billion related to litigation involving VLSI and a charge of $
401
million related to an EC-imposed fine, both as described below. Excluding the VLSI claims, management at present believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not materially harm our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or overall trends; however, legal proceedings and related government investigations are subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings, excessive verdicts, or other events could occur. Unfavorable resolutions could include substantial monetary damages, fines, or penalties. Certain of these outstanding matters include speculative, substantial, or indeterminate monetary awards. In addition, in matters for which injunctive relief or other conduct remedies are sought, unfavorable resolutions could include an injunction or other order prohibiting us from selling one or more products at all or in particular ways, precluding particular business practices, or requiring other remedies. An unfavorable outcome may result in a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, and overall trends. We might also conclude that settling one or more such matters is in the best interests of our stockholders, employees, and customers, and any such settlement could include substantial payments. Unless specifically described below, we have not concluded that settlement of any of the legal proceedings noted in this section is appropriate at this time.

European Commission Competition Matter
In 2009, the EC found that we had used unfair business practices to persuade customers to buy microprocessors in violation of Article 82 of the EC Treaty (later renumbered Article 102) and Article 54 of the European Economic Area Agreement. In general, the EC found that we violated Article 82 by offering alleged “conditional rebates and payments” that required customers to purchase all or most of their x86 microprocessors from us and by making alleged “payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.” The EC ordered us to end the alleged infringement referred to in its decision and imposed a €1.1 billion fine, which we paid in the third quarter of 2009.
We appealed the EC decision to the European Court of Justice in 2014, after the General Court (then called the Court of First Instance) rejected our appeal of the EC decision in its entirety. In September 2017, the Court of Justice sent the case back to the General Court to examine whether the rebates at issue were capable of restricting competition. In January 2022, the General Court annulled the EC’s 2009 findings against us regarding rebates, as well as the €1.1 billion fine imposed on Intel, which was returned to us in February 2022. The General Court’s January 2022 decision did not annul the EC’s 2009 finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products.
In April 2022 the EC appealed the General Court’s decision to the Court of Justice. In addition, in September 2023 the EC imposed a €376 million ($401 million) fine against us based on its finding that we made payments to prevent sales of specific rival products. We have appealed the EC’s decision. We have accrued a charge for the fine and are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses in excess of this amount given the procedural posture and the nature of these proceedings.
In a related matter, in April 2022 we filed applications with the General Court seeking an order requiring the EC to pay us approximately €593 million in default interest on the original €1.1 billion fine that was held by the EC for 12 years, which applications have been stayed pending the EC’s appeal of the General Court’s January 2022 decision.
Litigation Related to Security Vulnerabilities
In June 2017, a Google research team notified Intel and other companies that it had identified security vulnerabilities, the first variants of which are now commonly referred to as “Spectre” and “Meltdown,” that affect many types of microprocessors, including our products. As is standard when findings like these are presented, we worked together with other companies in the industry to verify the research and develop and validate software and firmware updates for impacted technologies. In January 2018, information on the security vulnerabilities was publicly reported, before software and firmware updates to address the vulnerabilities were made widely available.
As of April 24, 2024, consumer class action lawsuits against us were pending in the US and Canada. The plaintiffs, who purport to represent various classes of purchasers of our products, generally claim to have been harmed by our actions and/or omissions in connection with Spectre, Meltdown, and other variants of this class of security vulnerabilities that have been identified since 2018, and assert a variety of common law and statutory claims seeking monetary damages and equitable relief. In the US, class action suits filed in various jurisdictions between 2018 and 2021 were consolidated for all pretrial proceedings in the US District Court for the District of Oregon, which entered final judgment in favor of Intel in July 2022 based on plaintiffs’ failure to plead a viable claim. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court’s judgment in November 2023, ending the litigation. In November 2023, new plaintiffs filed a consumer class action complaint in the US District Court for the Northern District of California with respect to a further vulnerability variant disclosed in August 2023 and commonly referred to as “Downfall.” We moved to dismiss that complaint in January 2024. In Canada, an initial status conference has not yet been scheduled in one case relating to Spectre and Meltdown pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Ontario, and a stay of a second case pending in the Superior Court of Justice of Quebec is in effect.
In a class action relating to Spectre and Meltdown previously pending in Argentina, plaintiffs’ appeal of a May 2023 order dismissing their complaint for lack of standing was denied in February 2024, ending the lawsuit. Additional lawsuits and claims may be asserted seeking monetary damages or other related relief. Given the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that the pending proceedings are in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class or classes being certified or the ultimate size of any class or classes if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these matters.
Litigation Related to 7nm Product Delay Announcement
Multiple securities class action lawsuits were filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California against us and certain officers following our July 2020 announcement of 7nm product delays. The court consolidated the lawsuits and appointed lead plaintiffs in October 2020, and in January 2021 plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. Plaintiffs purport to represent all persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our common stock from October 25, 2019 through October 23, 2020, and they generally allege that defendants violated the federal securities laws by making false or misleading statements about the timeline for 7nm products. In March 2023, the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in April 2023 entered judgment. Plaintiffs appealed, and on April 19, 2024 the Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment; the Ninth Circuit’s ruling is subject to appeal. Given the procedural posture and the nature of the case, including that it is in the early stages, that alleged damages have not been specified, that uncertainty exists as to the likelihood of a class being certified or the ultimate size of any class if certified, and that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from the matter. In July 2021, we introduced a new process node naming structure, and the 7nm process is now called Intel 4.

Litigation Related to Patent and IP Claims
We have had IP infringement lawsuits filed against us, including but not limited to those discussed below. Most involve claims that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' IP rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial fines and penalties, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of revenue for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, certain agreements with our customers require us to indemnify them against certain IP infringement claims, which can increase our costs as a result of defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages, accept product returns, or supply our customers with non-infringing products if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenue and adversely affect our business.
VLSI Technology LLC v. Intel
In October 2017, VLSI Technology LLC (VLSI) filed a complaint against us in the US District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that various Intel FPGA and processor products infringe eight patents VLSI acquired from NXP Semiconductors, N.V. (NXP). Intel prevailed on all eight patents and the court entered final judgment in April 2024. Further appeals are possible. In April 2019, VLSI filed three infringement suits against us in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas accusing various of our processors of infringement of eight additional patents it had acquired from NXP:
▪
The first Texas case went to trial in February 2021, and the jury awarded VLSI $1.5 billion for literal infringement of one patent and $675 million for infringement of another patent under the doctrine of equivalents. In April 2022, the court entered final judgment, awarding VLSI $2.1 billion in damages and approximately $162.3 million in pre-judgment and post-judgment interest. We appealed the judgment to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, including the court’s rejection of Intel’s claim to have a license from Fortress Investment Group’s acquisition of Finjan. The Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument in October 2023. In December 2023, the Federal Circuit reversed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI was awarded $675 million. The Federal Circuit affirmed the finding of infringement as to the patent for which VLSI had been awarded $1.5 billion, but vacated the damages award and sent the case back to the trial court for further damages proceedings on that patent. The Federal Circuit also ruled that Intel can advance the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents. In December 2021 and January 2022 the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) instituted Inter Partes Reviews (IPR) on the claims found to have been infringed in the first Texas case, and in May and June 2023 found all of those claims unpatentable; VLSI has appealed the PTAB’s decision. In March 2024, Intel filed a motion to stay the case pending appeals of the IPRs. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents.
▪
The second Texas case went to trial in April 2021, and the jury found that we do not infringe the asserted patents. VLSI had sought approximately $3.0 billion for alleged infringement, plus enhanced damages for willful infringement. The court has not yet entered final judgment.
▪
The third Texas case went to trial in November 2022, with VLSI asserting one remaining patent. The jury found the patent valid and infringed, and awarded VLSI approximately $949 million in damages, plus interest and a running royalty. The court has not yet entered final judgment. In February 2023, we filed motions for a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law notwithstanding the verdict on various grounds. Further appeals are possible. In April 2024, Intel moved to add the defense that it is licensed to VLSI’s patents.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shenzhen Intermediate People’s Court against Intel, Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. VLSI asserted one patent against certain Intel Core processors. Defendants filed an invalidation petition in October 2019 with the China National Intellectual Property Administration (CNIPA) which held a hearing in September 2021. The Shenzhen court held trial proceedings in July 2021, and September 2023. VLSI sought an injunction as well as RMB 1.3 million in costs and expenses, but no damages. In September 2023, the CNIPA invalidated every claim of the asserted patent. In November 2023, the trial court dismissed VLSI’s case.
In May 2019, VLSI filed a case in Shanghai Intellectual Property Court against Intel (China) Co., Ltd., Intel Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and Intel Products (Chengdu) Co., Ltd. asserting one patent against certain Intel core processors. The court held a trial hearing in December 2020, where VLSI requested expenses (RMB 300 thousand) and an injunction. In December 2022, we filed a petition to invalidate the patent at issue. The court held a second trial hearing in May 2022, and in October 2023, issued a decision finding no infringement and dismissing all claims. In November 2023, VLSI appealed the finding of non-infringement.
As of March 30, 2024, we have accrued a charge of approximately $1.0 billion related to the VLSI litigation. While we dispute VLSI’s claims and intend to vigorously defend against them, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of losses in excess of recorded amounts given recent developments and future proceedings.

R2 Semiconductor Patent Litigation
In November 2022, R2 Semiconductor, Inc. (R2) filed a lawsuit in the High Court of Justice in the UK against Intel Corporation (UK) Limited and Intel Corporation, and a lawsuit in the Dusseldorf Regional Court in Germany against Intel Deutschland GmbH and certain Intel customers. R2 asserts one European patent is infringed by Intel’s Ice Lake, Tiger Lake, Alder Lake and Ice Lake Server (Xeon) processors (the accused products), and customer servers and laptops that contain those processors. R2 seeks an injunction in both actions prohibiting the sale and requiring the recall of the alleged infringing products. Intel is indemnifying its customers in the German lawsuit.
Intel disputes R2’s claims and intends to defend the lawsuits vigorously. In December 2022, Intel responded in the UK action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that the patent is invalid. In April 2023, defendants filed statements of defense in the German action that the asserted patent is not infringed and that an injunction would be a disproportionate remedy. In May 2023, defendants also filed a nullity action in the German Federal Patent Court on the ground that the asserted patent is invalid.
In December 2023, the German Federal Patent Court issued a preliminary opinion finding R2’s patent valid. The German Federal Patent Court’s final decision on invalidity is expected in October 2024. In December 2023, the court in Dusseldorf held a trial on the issue of infringement. In February 2024, the court found Intel’s processors infringe and issued an injunction and recall order against Intel and its customers. R2 has not yet sought to enforce the order. Intel has appealed the decision. In April 2024, Intel also filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court seeking a stay and a reversal of the finding of infringement and filed additional evidence with the appeals court to demonstrate that it does not infringe R2’s patent.
In March 2024, Intel filed an action in Milan, Italy seeking an order that it does not infringe R2’s patent.
In April 2024, R2 filed an action against Intel and its customers Dell, HP, and HPE for patent infringement in Paris, France. Intel and its customers have filed a nullity action against the patent in France.
Trial in the UK matter is scheduled for April 2024.
We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the potential loss or range of losses, if any, that might arise from these lawsuits and the injunction and order of the Dusseldorf Regional Court due to the procedural posture and the nature of these cases, including that there are significant factual and legal issues to be resolved and that uncertainty exists as to, among other things: (i) whether and, if so, at what point in time the order in Germany may take effect, including as a result of a potential stay; (ii) whether and, if so, at what point we may be successful in appealing the decisions in Germany as to infringement and validity, (iii) the extent to which we and our customers are able to mitigate the impact of the injunction of the Dusseldorf Regional Court, (iv) the costs of recalling products if the recall order of the Dusseldorf Regional Court is enforced, (v) the extent to which R2 may be awarded damages, and (vi) the extent to which we may agree to compensate our customers for losses in connection with the injunction and recall and any potential damage award.

Intel Products
Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for third party customers. Intel Products is comprised of three operating segments: CCG, DCAI, and NEX.
Financial Performance
Total Intel Products revenue was $11.9 billion in Q1 2024 and $10.2 billion in Q1 2023. Revenue increased primarily due to our CCG operating segment. Total Intel Products operating income increased to $3.3 billion, or 28% operating margin for Q1 2024 from $1.1 billion or 11% operating margin in Q1 2023. This Q1 2024 increase is primarily due to higher CCG revenue, lower period charges across each of the Intel Products' operating segments due to the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken, and lower CCG operating expenses and sample costs, partially offset by higher Q1 2024 unit costs in DCAI and CCG.

Consolidated Revenue
Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2023
Our Q1 2024 revenue was $12.7 billion, up $1.0 billion or 9% from Q1 2023. CCG revenue increased 31% from Q1 2023 primarily due to higher notebook and desktop volumes as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in Q1 2023. Notebook and desktop ASPs were roughly flat with Q1 2023. DCAI revenue increased 5% from Q1 2023 due to higher server ASPs primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products, partially offset by lower server volume due to lower demand in a competitive environment. NEX revenue decreased 8% primarily due to 5G customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories, partially offset by higher Edge and Network Xeon revenue. Altera revenue decreased 58% from Q1 2023 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and Mobileye revenue decreased 48% from Q1 2023 as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories across EyeQ products. External Intel Foundry revenue decreased 77% from Q1 2023 due to lower multi-beam mask writer tool sales.
Incentives offered to certain customers to accelerate purchases and to strategically position our products with customers for market segment share purposes, particularly in CCG, contributed approximately $1.6 billion to our revenue during Q1 2024 compared to approximately $900 million during Q1 2023. The impacts of these Q1 2024 incentives were contemplated in our financial guidance for Q2 2024, as included in our Form 8-K dated April 25, 2024.

Gains (Losses) on Equity Investments and Interest and Other, Net
Ongoing mark-to-market adjustments for Q1 2024 were primarily driven by our interests in Astera Labs, Inc and Montage Technology Co., Ltd; Q1 2023 was primarily related to our interest in Montage Technology Co., Ltd and others.
In Q1 2024, we recognized a $336 million initial fair value adjustment within
sale of equity investments and other
upon Astera Labs, Inc shares becoming marketable.
Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes
In Q1 2024, we recognized a benefit from taxes as we applied our year-to-date actual effective tax rate to our year-to-date measure of ordinary income (loss) before taxes, which reflects our jurisdictional mix of ordinary income and losses.
Our provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period has historically been determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items, if any. Under certain circumstances where we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate, we use the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period. In Q1 2024, we used the actual effective tax rate approach due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
We consider the following when assessing our liquidity and capital resources:
We believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our business requirements for the next 12 months and in the longer term. Cash generated by operations, and total cash and short-term investments as shown in the preceding table, are our primary sources of liquidity for funding our strategic business requirements. These sources are further supplemented by our committed credit facilities and other borrowing capacity and certain other Smart Capital initiatives that we have undertaken. Our short-term funding requirements include capital expenditures for worldwide manufacturing and assembly and test, including investments in our process technology roadmap; working capital requirements; and potential acquisitions, strategic investments, and dividends. Our long-term funding requirements incrementally contemplate investments in significant manufacturing expansion plans and investments to accelerate our process technology.
Our total cash and short-term investments
and related cash flows may be affected by certain discretionary actions we may take with customers and suppliers to accelerate or delay certain cash receipts or payments to manage liquidity for our strategic business requirements. These actions can include, among others, negotiating with suppliers to optimize our payment terms and conditions, adjusting the timing of cash flows associated with customer sales programs and collections, managing inventory levels and purchasing practices, and selling certain of our accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third party financial institutions.
We expect to continue to benefit from government incentives, and any incentives above our current expectations would enable us to increase the pace and size of our IDM 2.0 investments. Conversely, incentives below our expectations would increase our anticipated cash requirements and/or potentially curtail planned investments.
In April 2024 our Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.125 per share on the company’s common stock, which will be payable on June 1, 2024, to stockholders of record as of May 7, 2024. Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.
In Q1 2024, we issued a total of $2.6 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes for general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, refinancing of outstanding debt and funding for working capital and capital expenditures.
We also
expanded both our 5-year $5.0 billion revolving credit facility agreement and our 364-day $5.0 billion credit facility agreement, to $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively, and the maturity dates were extended by one year to February 2029 and January 2025, respectively. We have other potential sources of liquidity including our commercial paper program and our automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC, pursuant to which we may offer an unspecified amount of debt, equity, and other securities. Under our commercial paper program, we have an ongoing authorization from our Board of Directors to borrow up to $10.0 billion. As of March 30, 2024, we had $793 million of commercial paper obligations outstanding. As of March 30, 2024, we had no outstanding borrowings on the revolving credit facilities.
We maintain a diverse investment portfolio that we continually analyze based on issuer, industry, and country. Substantially all of our investments in debt instruments were in investment-grade securities.
Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for Q1 2024 and Q1 2023 were as follows:
Operating Activities
Operating cash flows consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities.
The decrease in cash used for operations in the first three months of 2024 was primarily driven by a lower net operating loss compared to the first three months of 2023, partially offset by certain cash unfavorable changes in working capital.
Table of Contents
Investing Activities
Investing cash flows consist primarily of capital expenditures; investment purchases, sales, maturities, and disposals; and proceeds from capital-related government incentives.
Cash used for investing activities was lower in the first three months of 2024 compared to the first three months of 2023, primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments; lower additions to property, plant, and equipment; and increased proceeds from capital-related government incentives. These favorable cash impacts were partially offset by lower maturities and sales of short-term investments and certain other cash unfavorable investing activities during the first three months of 2024.
Financing Activities
Financing cash flows consist primarily of payment of dividends to stockholders, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, and proceeds from partner contributions and equity-related issuances.
Cash provided by financing activities was lower in the first three months of 2024 compared to the first three months of 2023. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in net proceeds from our debt and commercial paper issuances, net of commercial paper repayments; partially offset by the cash favorable impacts of reduced dividend payments in the first three months of 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
In addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with US GAAP, this document contains references to the non-GAAP financial measures below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about our operating performance, enable comparison of financial trends and results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are used in our performance-based RSUs and our cash bonus plans.
Our non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on one or more of the following items, as well as the related income tax effects. Income tax effects are calculated using a fixed long-term projected tax rate of 13% across all adjustments. We project this long-term non-GAAP tax rate on an annual basis using a five-year non-GAAP financial projection that excludes the income tax effects of each adjustment. The projected non-GAAP tax rate also considers factors such as our tax structure, our tax positions in various jurisdictions, and key legislation in significant jurisdictions where we operate. This long-term non-GAAP tax rate may be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in our geographic earnings mix, or changes to our strategy or business operations. Management uses this non-GAAP tax rate in managing internal short- and long-term operating plans and in evaluating our performance; we believe this approach facilitates comparison of our operating results and provides useful evaluation of our current operating performance.
Our non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP, and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP and reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

Risk Factors
The risks described in "Risk Factors" within Other Key Information in our 2023 Form 10-K could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could decline. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face—our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. Due to risks and uncertainties, known and unknown, our past financial results may not be a reliable indicator of future performance and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. Refer also to the other information set forth in this Form 10-Q, including in the Forward-Looking Statements, MD&A, and the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Supplemental Details sections.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We are affected by changes in currency exchange and interest rates, as well as equity and commodity prices. Our risk management programs are designed to reduce, but may not entirely eliminate, the impacts of these risks. For a discussion about market risk and sensitivity analysis related to changes in currency exchange rates, interest rates, equity prices, and commodity prices refer to "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" within MD&A in our 2023 Form 10-K.
Controls and Procedures
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on management’s evaluation (with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer), as of the end of the period covered by this report, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended March 30, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
We have an ongoing authorization, originally approved by our Board of Directors in 2005 and subsequently amended, to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions. No shares were repurchased during the quarter ending March 30, 2024. As of March 30, 2024, we were authorized to repurchase up to $110.0 billion, of which $7.2 billion remained available.
We issue RSUs as part of our equity incentive plans. In our Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, we treat shares of common stock withheld for tax purposes on behalf of our employees in connection with the vesting of RSUs as common stock repurchases because they reduce the number of shares that would have been issued upon vesting. These withheld shares of common stock are not considered common stock repurchases under our authorized common stock repurchase program.
Rule 10b5-1 Trading Arrangements
Our directors and officers (as defined in Rule 16a-1 under the Exchange Act) may from time to time enter into plans or other arrangements for the purchase or sale of our shares that are intended to satisfy the affirmative defense conditions of Rule 10b5–1(c) or may represent a non-Rule 10b5-1 trading arrangement under the Exchange Act. During the quarter ended March 30, 2024, no such plans or arrangements were
adopted
or
terminated
, including by modification.

Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires an issuer to disclose certain information in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions, or dealings with individuals or entities subject to specific US economic sanctions during the reporting period, even when the activities, transactions, or dealings are conducted in compliance with applicable law. On March 2, 2021, the US Secretary of State designated the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB) as a party subject to one such sanction. Though Intel has suspended sales in Russia, there may be a need to file documents or engage with FSB as Intel winds up our local Russian offices. All such dealings are explicitly authorized by General License 1B issued by the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and there are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such dealings by us with the FSB.
On April 15, 2021, the US Department of the Treasury designated Pozitiv Teknolodzhiz, AO (Positive Technologies), a Russian IT security firm, as a party subject to one of the sanctions specified in Section 13(r). Prior to the designation, we communicated with Positive Technologies regarding its IT security research and coordinated disclosure of security vulnerabilities identified by the firm. Based on a license issued by OFAC, we resumed such communications. There are no gross revenues or net profits directly associated with any such activities. We plan to continue these communications in accordance with the terms and conditions of the OFAC license.
